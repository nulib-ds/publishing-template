- The submission is written in widely accessible language, free of field-specific jargon and unnecessarily technical language.

- The submission has not been previously published, nor is it before another journal for consideration. If the submission uses the same primary data set and has been published or already accepted for publication with another outlet, the cover letter details how the present submission differs from the other manuscript(s) in terms of range, scope, and theoretical and/or practical significance.

- The submission adheres to the relevant word limit for its [submission type](/guidelines/#submission-types).

- The submission files adhere to with the journal’s [formatting](/guidelines/#formatting) requirements and are in either Microsoft Word/OfficeOpen (`.docx`) or OpenDocument (`.odt`) format.

- The author(s) have included a cover letter in the “Comments to the Editor” box that (1) affirms that the submitted research complies with the journal’s stated [Publication Ethics](/guidelines/#publication-ethics) policy; (2) provides ***three recommended peer reviewers*** who are well qualified to assess the submission’s quality, but who have no direct familiarity with the work; and (3) discloses any and all conflicts of interest.
