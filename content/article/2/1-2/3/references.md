- abstract: AbstractBackground Research shows that transmasculine people
    experience discrimination based on their gender identity and/or
    expression (i.e., cissexism) while obtaining health care. However,
    studies examining the experience of other forms of discrimination in
    health care settings among diverse subgroups of transmasculine
    individuals, including those from minoritized racial/ethnic
    backgrounds, are very limited.Methods Guided by intersectionality,
    we designed a qualitative research study to explore how
    transmasculine people of color experience---and resist---multiple,
    intersecting forms of discrimination in health care settings. Guided
    by a purposive sampling strategy, we selected 19 transmasculine
    young adults of color aged 18--25 years to participate in 5
    mini-focus groups conducted between February and May 2019 in Boston,
    MA. Focus group transcripts were analyzed using a template style
    approach to thematic analysis that involved both deductive and
    inductive coding using a codebook. Coded text fragments pertaining
    to participants' experiences of health care discrimination were
    clustered into themes and sub-themes.Results Transmasculine people
    of color described experiencing notable challenges accessing
    physical and mental health care as a result of structural barriers
    to identifying health care providers with expertise in transgender
    health, finding providers who share one or more of their social
    positions and lived experiences, and accessing financial resources
    to cover high health care costs. Further, participants discussed
    anticipating and experiencing multiple forms of interpersonal
    discrimination---both independently and simultaneously---in health
    care settings, including cissexism, racism, weight-based
    discrimination, and ableism. Moreover, participants described the
    negative impact of anticipating and experiencing multiple
    interpersonal health care discrimination on their health care
    utilization, quality of care, and mental and physical health.
    Lastly, participants discussed using various strategies to resist
    the multiple, intersecting forms of discrimination they encounter in
    health care settings, including setting boundaries with health care
    providers, seeking care from competent providers with shared social
    positions, engaging in self-advocacy, drawing on peer support during
    health care visits, and obtaining health information through their
    social networks.Discussion Efforts are needed to address cissexism,
    racism, weight-based discrimination, ableism, and other intersecting
    forms of discrimination in clinical encounters, health care
    institutions and systems, and society in general to advance the
    health of transmasculine people of color and other multiply
    marginalized groups.

- abstract: Although informed consent models for prescribing hormone
    replacement therapy are becoming increasingly prevalent, many
    physicians continue to require an assessment and referral letter
    from a mental health professional prior to prescription. Drawing on
    personal and communal experience, the author argues that assessment
    and referral requirements are dehumanising and unethical,
    foregrounding the ways in which these requirements evidence a
    mistrust of trans people, suppress the diversity of their
    experiences and sustain an unjustified double standard in contrast
    to other forms of clinical care. Physicians should abandon this
    unethical requirement in favour of an informed consent approach to
    transgender care.

- abstract: "Semistructured in-depth interviews are commonly used in
    qualitative research and are the most frequent qualitative data
    source in health services research. This method typically consists
    of a dialogue between researcher and participant, guided by a
    flexible interview protocol and supplemented by follow-up questions,
    probes and comments. The method allows the researcher to collect
    open-ended data, to explore participant thoughts, feelings and
    beliefs about a particular topic and to delve deeply into personal
    and sometimes sensitive issues. The purpose of this article was to
    identify and describe the essential skills to designing and
    conducting semistructured interviews in family medicine and primary
    care research settings. We reviewed the literature on semistructured
    interviewing to identify key skills and components for using this
    method in family medicine and primary care research settings.
    Overall, semistructured interviewing requires both a relational
    focus and practice in the skills of facilitation. Skills include:
    (1) determining the purpose and scope of the study; (2) identifying
    participants; (3) considering ethical issues; (4) planning
    logistical aspects; (5) developing the interview guide; (6)
    establishing trust and rapport; (7) conducting the interview; (8)
    memoing and reflection; (9) analysing the data; (10) demonstrating
    the trustworthiness of the research; and (11) presenting findings in
    a paper or report. Semistructured interviews provide an effective
    and feasible research method for family physicians to conduct in
    primary care research settings. Researchers using semistructured
    interviews for data collection should take on a relational focus and
    consider the skills of interviewing to ensure quality.
    Semistructured interviewing can be a powerful tool for family
    physicians, primary care providers and other health services
    researchers to use to understand the thoughts, beliefs and
    experiences of individuals. Despite the utility, semistructured
    interviews can be intimidating and challenging for researchers not
    familiar with qualitative approaches. In order to elucidate this
    method, we provide practical guidance for researchers, including
    novice researchers and those with few resources, to use
    semistructured interviewing as a data collection strategy. We
    provide recommendations for the essential steps to follow in order
    to best implement semistructured interviews in family medicine and
    primary care research settings."

- abstract: Research indicates that rural transgender and gender diverse
    (TGD) populations have a greater need for health services when
    compared with their urban counterparts, face unique barriers to
    accessing services, and have health disparities that are less
    researched than urban TGD populations. Therefore, the primary aim of
    this mixed-methods study (n = 24) was to increase research on the
    health care needs of TGD people in a rural Appalachian American
    context. This study was guided by a community-engaged model
    utilizing a community advisory board of TGD people and supportive
    parents of TGD children. Quantitative results indicate that travel
    burden is high, affirming provider availability is low, and the
    impacts on the health and mental health of TGD people in this sample
    are notable. Qualitative results provide recommendations for
    providers and health care systems to better serve this population.
    Integrated mixed-methods results further illustrate ways that rural
    TGD people and families adapt to the services available to them,
    sometimes at significant economic and emotional costs. This study
    contributes to the small but growing body of literature on the
    unique needs of rural TGD populations, including both adults and
    minors with supportive parents, by offering insights into strategies
    to address known disparities.

- abstract: ABSTRACT INTRODUCTIONPrimary health care providers are
    playing an increasingly important role in providing gender-affirming
    health care for gender diverse people. This article explores the
    experiences of a primary care-based pilot clinic providing
    gender-affirming hormone therapy in Wellington, New Zealand. AIMTo
    evaluate service users' and health professionals' experiences of a
    pilot clinic at Mauri Ora (Victoria University of Wellington's
    Student Health and Counselling Service) that provided
    gender-affirming hormones through primary care. METHODSIn-depth
    interviews were conducted with four (out of six) service users and
    four health professionals about their perspectives on the clinic.
    Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic
    analysis. RESULTSThree themes were identified in service users'
    interviews, who discussed receiving affirming care due to the
    clinic's accessibility, relationship-centred care and timeliness.
    Three themes were identified in the health professionals'
    interviews, who described how the clinic involves partnership,
    affirms users' gender and agency, and is adaptable to other primary
    care settings. Both service users and health professionals discussed
    concerns about the lack of adequate funding for primary care
    services and the tensions between addressing mental health needs and
    accessing timely care. DISCUSSIONThe experiences of service users
    and health professionals confirm the value of providing
    gender-affirming hormone therapy in primary care. Models based in
    primary care are likely to increase accessibility, depathologise
    gender diversity and reduce wait times.

- abstract: Sample sizes must be ascertained in qualitative studies like
    in quantitative studies but not by the same means. The prevailing
    concept for sample size in qualitative studies is "saturation."
    Saturation is closely tied to a specific methodology, and the term
    is inconsistently applied. We propose the concept "information
    power" to guide adequate sample size for qualitative studies.
    Information power indicates that the more information the sample
    holds, relevant for the actual study, the lower amount of
    participants is needed. We suggest that the size of a sample with
    sufficient information power depends on (a) the aim of the study,
    (b) sample specificity, (c) use of established theory, (d) quality
    of dialogue, and (e) analysis strategy. We present a model where
    these elements of information and their relevant dimensions are
    related to information power. Application of this model in the
    planning and during data collection of a qualitative study is
    discussed.

- abstract: "Objective Hormone treatment is an important part of gender
    reassignment therapy in gender dysphoria. Previous data about
    efficacy and safety are commonly based on small cohorts or they
    comprise former cohorts under meanwhile obsolete therapy regimes.
    Our objective was to investigate these topics in a large cohort of
    individuals under guideline-based treatment.Design/methodsCohort
    study of medical files of n  = 155 male-to-female (transwomen) and n
     = 233 female-to-male transgender persons (transmen) of an Endocrine
    outpatient clinic between 2009 and 2017.ResultsMedian time to reach
    amenorrhoea in transmen under testosterone monotherapy was 3 months,
    regardless of whether testosterone undecanoat or gel was used.
    Transmen with higher levels of hemoglobin 3--4 months after onset of
    GAHT had a greater chance to reach amenorrhea early, whereas
    testosterone levels showed no significant correlation (hemoglobin:
    HR: 1.639; 95% CI: 1.036--2.591, P  = 0.035; testosterone: HR:
    0.999; 95% CI: 0.998--1.001, P  = 0.490). Estradiol levels (ρ
    −0.117; P  = 0.316) had no significant influence on breast
    development in transwomen. Testosterone levels (ρ −0.398; P
     \\<\\< 0.001) and FAI (ρ 0.346; P  = 0.004) were significantly
    negatively correlated with reached Tanner stage. Liver values and
    blood lipids showed an alignment to reference range of the required
    sex in both groups. Relevant elevations of liver values were rare
    (2.44% in transmen, 4.23% in transwomen) and transient in most
    cases. Most relevant side effects were acne (44.8%), respectively
    erythrocytosis (up to 5.6%) in transmen and venous thrombembolism
    (1.9%) in transwomen.Conclusions Gender-affirming hormone therapy in
    accordance with current clinical practice guidelines is efficient
    and safe."

- abstract: Historically, researchers and clinicians have viewed the
    transgender experience through a narrow diagnostic lens and have
    neglected to acknowledge the diverse experiences of those who
    identify as transgender. Currently, under the mainstream treatment
    paradigm, in order to be deemed eligible for gender transition
    services, transgender clients must meet criteria for a diagnosis of
    "gender dysphoria" as described in the DSM-5. An alternative to the
    diagnostic model for transgender health is the Informed Consent
    Model, which allows for clients who are transgender to access
    hormone treatments and surgical interventions without undergoing
    mental health evaluation or referral from a mental health
    specialist. This model shows promise for the treatment and
    understanding of the transgender experience outside of the lens of
    medical pathologization.

- abstract: "AbstractBackground Past research has established that
    transgender people experience significant disparities in mental
    health outcomes and healthcare dissatisfaction compared with
    cisgender people, but more research is needed on how supportive
    healthcare interactions relate to the mental health of transgender
    people.Objectives The 2 main aims of our analyses were: (i) to
    establish the most common negative experiences in healthcare and the
    most common supportive experiences specifically with primary care
    doctors for transgender people; and (ii) to examine the association
    of supportive experiences with mental health variables after
    controlling for demographic factors.Methods Data from the 2018
    Counting Ourselves nationwide survey of transgender people were
    analysed using regression modelling. The 948 participants with a
    primary care doctor or general practitioner were included in
    analyses. Participants were aged 14--83 years old (mean
    30.20).Results The most common supportive experiences involved
    primary care doctors treating transgender people equitably, with
    competence, and with respect. Participants with more negative
    healthcare experiences had higher psychological distress as well as
    higher likelihood of reporting nonsuicidal self-injury and
    suicidality. Conversely, participants with more experiences of
    supportive primary care doctors had lower psychological distress and
    were less likely to have attempted suicide in the past 12
    months.Conclusion When transgender people receive supportive care
    from their primary care providers they experience better mental
    health, despite ongoing negative healthcare experiences. Future
    research is needed to confirm ways of supporting positive
    trajectories of mental health for transgender people but these
    findings demonstrate the importance of positive aspects of care."

- abstract: "AbstractBackground Transgender, or trans, people experience
    a number of barriers to accessing gender-affirming healthcare and
    have a range of barriers and facilitators to primary care and
    specialist services, commonly citing discrimination and cisgenderism
    playing a central role in shaping accessibility. The pathway through
    primary care to specialist services is a particularly precarious
    time for trans people, and misinformation and poorly applied
    protocols can have a detrimental impact on wellbeing.Method We
    recruited trans participants from an HIV Self-Testing Public Health
    Intervention (SELPHI) trial to interviews which explored
    contemporary gender-affirming service experiences, with an aim to
    examine the path from primary care services through to specialist
    gender services, in the UK.Results A narrative synthesis of
    vignettes and thematic analysis of in-depth qualitative interviews
    were conducted with twenty trans individuals. We summarise positive
    and negative accounts of care under three broad categories:
    Experiences with primary care physicians, referrals to gender
    identity clinics (GICs), and experiences at GICs.Conclusions We
    discuss implications of this research in terms of how to improve
    best practice for trans people attempting to access gender-affirming
    healthcare in the UK. Here we highlight the importance of GP's
    access to knowledge around pathways and protocols and clinical
    practice which treats trans patients holistically."
