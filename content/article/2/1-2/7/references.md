- abstract: Abstract In conversation with Emmett Harsin Drager and
    Andrea Long Chu's "After Trans Studies," this collaborative essay
    also turns to questions of field formation and the ethos of trans
    studies. Situating the growth of the field in the material
    conditions of precarity under which trans knowledge-workers work,
    the authors argue that trans studies can't be "over" because, in
    fact, it isn't yet here. Rather than viewing this as only a dismal
    proposition, however, they insist that the tenuousness of trans
    studies provides us with the opportunity to envision and enact more
    sustaining ways of being "in the field."

- abstract: Trans is both an umbrella term for heterogeneous identities
    and a discrete collective identity type unto itself. It now
    encompasses a wide range of binary and nonbinary identifications
    like transsexual and transgender. Social movements arising that take
    up trans issues do so with certain caveats. Many make the important
    distinction that "trans"trans describes human practices and social
    identities preceding the construction of its modern name and
    meaning. Furthermore, social movements and activism advance the
    argument that trans embodiments are not confined to Western or
    medical imaginaries. Indeed, what is expressed within trans identity
    narratives have gone by other cultural names, with diverse histories
    all their own. The rise and ongoing role of American trans activism
    within social and political domains are careful to consider the
    narrative histories being summoned. Trans social movements are
    generally aware of the risks that analytic terms like movement or
    protest might imply.For better or worse, scholars often associate
    the rise of social and political protest movements of the 20th
    century in broadly fantastic terms. The emergence of trans
    communities, however, unfolded over the course of a century. The
    episodic ruptures that mark historical events (Compton's Cafeteria
    or the Stonewall riots) tend to spur organizational consolidation.
    Indeed, many of the most recent trends in trans activism then
    consolidated into organized interests. On that many scholars can
    agree. But the historical process that led to this point of trans
    politics is not clear-cut. Often eclipsed by the twin narrative of
    queer liberation, trans social movements linger among a number of
    narrative histories. Three periodizations help identify how trans
    narratives of identity and social justice are deployed, by whom, and
    for what purpose.The nominal period marks the rise of transsexual
    identities as they emerged within the space of medical currents in
    the early 20th century. Trans people in mid-century America may have
    participated in the power of medical discourse in their own lives.
    For example, autobiographical texts describe psychic pain,
    depression, and suicidal ideation that were alleviated only through
    transition. Naming provides intelligibility to an otherwise opaque
    set of phenomena. The symbolic period moves away from privileging
    the medical archive to highlight the connections made between
    radical identity groups and the growth of organized resources by and
    for trans activists. Narratives here are socially symbolic and
    detail how terms like transsexual and transgender(ist) entered a
    complex cultural milieu. Many activists would permanently shape the
    lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, intersex, and agender (LGBTIA)
    communities for decades. The symbolic emphasizes a politics of
    narrative origins. Identifying the events and voices that shaped the
    mainstream conception of trans issues is critical to contemporary
    movements for social justice. The pluralist period reflects upon the
    various institutional interventions that shaped popular discourse
    around sex and gender in everyday life for trans people. It
    typically recasts the last three decades of the 20th century as a
    crucial epoch in trans activism (for both social and political
    forces). Between 1980 and 1990, new energy emerged that ran on the
    heels of a new posttranssexual politics. What emerged in the early
    2000s was a rapid growth of organized advocacy and interest-group
    formation. Many of the organizations are still active and continue
    to shape national, state, and local policies. They represent one
    form of a blend of movement-related strategies for participating in
    the construction and durability of trans politics.

- abstract: "I argue for a new model of public scholarship in the field
    of communication---one that defines public-ness not in terms of
    publicity but in terms of the public good. Synthesizing work on
    public scholarship in communication and sociology with participatory
    action research frameworks, I narrate my experiences of fieldwork in
    the U.S. transgender rights movement. In doing so, I demonstrate the
    reciprocal benefits of fieldwork for both scholars and the publics
    served by social justice organizations. I further discuss the depths
    of public engagement permitted and achieved via fieldwork relative
    to publicity-centered scholarship. Finally, I address the ideal role
    of public engagement as scholars: contributing specialized skills
    and knowledge toward the mitigation of social problems. Ultimately,
    I argue, if a scholar publicly engages in issues of social justice
    without orienting their public work toward alleviating injustice,
    then they are actively sustaining the systems of oppression they
    benefit from researching."

- abstract: Whereas social movement--media relations were, in the era of
    mass media, a dialogic relationship of mutual, albeit asymmetric,
    dependency between news makers and social movement organizations,
    the hybridization of the media system has complicated matters
    considerably. The dialogic tensions that drove organizations' access
    to the political information environment have been supplanted by new
    tensions---tensions that have transformed organizations' media work
    routines. Organizations must now manage tensions over the
    temporality of issue emergence, tensions between identity and policy
    knowledge as sources of expertise, tensions between emotional charge
    and informational novelty as criteria of newsworthiness for
    journalists, and tensions between policy demands and media demands
    in the formation of communications strategy. And these new tensions
    demand new work practices oriented toward addressing multiple
    audiences concurrently and via multiple media streams. Because the
    discourses of social media influence the press to such an extent,
    the successful management of press discourse requires both direct
    influence via routine media work targeting journalists and indirect
    influence via steering digital media discourse---the combination of
    which presents significant resource costs to movement organizations.
    This article draws on an ethnographic case study of media work in
    the U.S. transgender rights movement to extend theorizations of
    movement--media relations to account for the structuring influence
    of the hybrid media system, illustrating these news tensions in the
    context of the panic over transgender passport policy that erupted
    in the summer of 2018.

- abstract: This roundtable began as the first panel of the
    International Communication Association dedicated exclusively to
    transgender studies. The articles of the panel investigated various
    domains of mediated representation, from television to newspapers to
    online pornography to Tumblr blogs. The differences in media,
    methods, and theoretical frameworks across the articles allowed for
    the panel to cover a broad swath of transgender representation in
    the current media environment. At the same time, their intersections
    allowed for conversation to move beyond theoretical understandings
    of media representation inherited from feminist and LGB studies to
    think about what transgender-specific modes of representation may
    be, how they differ from other modes of representation, and how the
    consequences of these transgender-specific modes may also,
    therefore, differ. After some time away to reflect, the panelists
    sat back down to answer important questions about how their work
    pushes both the theory and the practice of transgender media
    representation forward.

- abstract: As the primary vector by which society tells itself about
    itself, popular media transmit ideas of what behavior is acceptable
    and whose identities are legitimate, thereby perpetuating and, at
    times, transforming the social order. Thus, media have been key
    targets of LGBT advocacy and activism and important contributors to
    the political standing of LGBT people. Of course, media are not a
    monolith, and different types of media inform different parts of
    society. Community media have been an important infrastructure
    through which gays and lesbians and, separately, transgender people
    formed shared identities and developed collective political
    consciousness. Political media, such as newspapers, news websites,
    and network and cable television news broadcasts, inform elites and
    the mass public alike, making them an important influence on public
    opinion and political behavior. Entertainment media, such as
    television and film, cultivate our culture's shared values and
    ideas, which infuse into the public's political beliefs and
    attitudes. Generally speaking, the literature on LGBTQ politics and
    the media is biased toward news and public affairs media over
    fictional and entertainment media, though both are important
    influences on LGBTQ citizens' political engagement, as well as on
    citizens' public opinion toward LGBTQ rights and their subsequent
    political behaviors. In the case of the former, media---particularly
    LG(BT) community media---have played an important role in
    facilitating the formation of a shared social and then political
    identity, as well as fueling the formation of, first, separate gay
    and lesbian and transgender movements and then a unified LGBTQ
    movement. Moreover, digital media have enabled new modes of
    political organizing and exercising sociopolitical influence, making
    LGBTQ activism more diverse, more intersectional, more pluralistic,
    and more participatory. In the case of the latter, (news) media
    representations of LGBTQ individuals initially portrayed them in
    disparaging and disrespectful ways. Over time, representations in
    both news and entertainment media have come to portray them in ways
    that legitimate their identities and their political claims. These
    representations, in turn, have had profound impacts on public
    opinion toward LGBTQ rights and citizens' LGBTQ-relevant voting
    behavior. Yet, the literature on these representations and their
    effects overwhelmingly focuses on gays and lesbians at the expense
    of bisexual and transgender people, and this work is done primarily
    in U.S. and Anglophone contexts, limiting our understanding of the
    relationships between LGBTQ politics and the media globally.

    conditions force trans studies against queer theory: Because queer
    theory is the institutional context through which trans studies is
    invited into the university, it is also the containing ideological
    architecture against which trans studies must articulate itself.
    Trans studies is therefore pressed \"against\" queer theory as a
    discursive surface in a manner that limits it from being able to
    exit this disciplinary scenario."

    essays commissioned for the inaugural issue of TSQ: Transgender
    Studies Quarterly. Written by emerging academics, community-based
    writers, and senior scholars, each essay in this special issue,
    \"Postposttranssexual: Key Concepts for a Twenty-First-Century
    Transgender Studies,\" revolves around a particular keyword or
    concept. Some contributions focus on a concept central to
    transgender studies; others describe a term of art from another
    discipline or interdisciplinary area and show how it might relate to
    transgender studies. While far from providing a complete picture of
    the field, these keywords begin to elucidate a conceptual vocabulary
    for transgender studies. Some of the submissions offer a deep and
    resilient resistance to the entire project of mapping the field
    terminologically; some reveal yet-unrealized critical potentials for
    the field; some take existing terms from canonical thinkers and
    develop the significance for transgender studies; some offer
    overviews of well-known methodologies and demonstrate their
    applicability within transgender studies; some suggest how
    transgender issues play out in various fields; and some map the
    productive tensions between trans studies and other
    interdisciplines."

  title: The remarkable rise of transgender rights
  type: book
- abstract: Abstract This essay examines the history of the Tretter
    Collection in GLBT Studies at the University of Minnesota Libraries.
    The Tretter Collection today has strong holdings about white gay
    men, lesser holdings about lesbians, and large gaps in material
    about people of color, bisexuals, and the transgender community. I
    argue that this is the result both of its history and of broader
    societal forces that limit the production of material by and for
    these communities. While unique, many elements in the Tretter story
    hold true for other GLBT archives and may help researchers
    contextualize what they find (and do not find) as well as encourage
    more discussion about strategies for diversifying GLBT voices in our
    collections. I explore the strategies I have used to begin filling
    gaps in the archive, focusing on the inclusion of transgender
    voices.
