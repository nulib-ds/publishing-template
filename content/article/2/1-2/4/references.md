  type: book
- abstract: Is queer social science possible? Early queer theorists
    disparaged empiricism as a normalizing, modernist discourse.
    Nonetheless, LGBTQI+ social scientists have applied queer concepts
    in empirical projects. Rather than seek a queer method, we ask, Is
    there an empirical perspective that (ontologically) envisions social
    relations more queerly---attending to discursive and materialist
    productions of reality? Dorothy Smith's work foregrounds people's
    activities of engaging texts and satisfies Black queer studies' and
    new materialisms' critiques of early queer theory. Underutilized and
    often misread, especially its ethnomethodological sensibilities and
    its vision of actors as relational, practical actors, her work shows
    how my race is not mine, it is ours; your sexual orientation is not
    yours, it is ours; their gender is not theirs, it is ours. Smith
    offers an ontology without essence, grand theory, or normativity,
    facilitating a range of queer, interpretive projects---from the
    intersectional to the transnational to the embodied.

- abstract: In these newly collected essays, interviews, and speeches,
    world-renowned activist and scholar Angela Y. Davis illuminates the
    connections between struggles against state violence and oppression
    throughout history and around the world. Reflecting on the
    importance of black feminism, intersectionality, and prison
    abolitionism for today's struggles, Davis discusses the legacies of
    previous liberation struggles, from the Black Freedom Movement to
    the South African anti-Apartheid movement. She highlights
    connections and analyzes today's struggles against state terror,
    from Ferguson to Palestine. Facing a world of outrageous injustice,
    Davis challenges us to imagine and build the movement for human
    liberation. And in doing so, she reminds us that \"Freedom is a
    constant struggle.\"

- abstract: While the Internet has dramatically increased the exposure
    that research can receive, it has also facilitated harassment
    against scholars. To understand the impact that these attacks can
    have on the work of researchers, we perform a series of systematic
    interviews with researchers including academics, journalists, and
    activists, who have experienced targeted, Internet-facilitated
    harassment. We provide a framework for understanding the types of
    harassers that target researchers, the harassment that ensues, and
    the personal and professional impact on individuals and academic
    freedom. We then study preventative and remedial strategies
    available, and the institutions that prevent some of these
    strategies from being more effective. Finally, we discuss the
    ethical structures that could facilitate more equitable access to
    participating in research without serious personal suffering.

- abstract: A Media Matters study of interactions (reactions, comments,
    shares) on published online content about trans topics shared on
    Facebook found that right-leaning sources earned considerably higher
    engagement than all other sources combined. This study comes after
    Media Matters has extensively and repeatedly debunked allegations of
    a bias against right-wing content on Facebook. Despite this,
    Facebook has consistently caved to conservative demands. It has
    granted conservatives top positions at the company, included
    right-wing Breitbart News in a list of trusted news sources,
    met with right-wing media personalities like Tucker Carlson, and
    allowed the "trending" function to be taken over by an algorithm
    that often promotes false, partisan right-wing news. We looked at
    225 pieces of high-performing content on trans topics -- articles,
    blog posts, videos -- which earned a combined total of nearly 66
    million interactions on Facebook. Content about trans people and
    related topics from right-leaning sources constituted 65.7% of those
    interactions. Comparatively, 15.4% of all interactions were earned
    by content from queer sources, 3.9% from left-leaning sources, 10.4%
    from nonaligned sources, and 4.6% from \"other\" sources. In
    particular, content from right-leaning sources about trans athletes
    and about medical care for trans folks, specifically trans youth,
    earned high engagement, and right-wing outlets The Daily Wire and
    LifeSiteNews published more high-performing Facebook content about
    trans issues than any other outlets.  This has consequences.
    Millions of Americans get their news from Facebook and other social
    media platforms; Pew Research Center found that 52% of Americans get
    news on Facebook. Media Matters' analysis of trans-related content
    shared on Facebook shows that those Americans are often getting
    biased, bigoted, and misinformative news. This content directly
    harms public discourse and policy surrounding trans folks. 
    Furthermore, this discourse has undoubtedly led to the online
    harassment and abuse of trans people, who have been victims of
    doxxing -- the act of publishing a person's private or personal
    information, including address or location. In fact, according to a
    2019 Forbes report, "12% of all conversations about being trans
    contain abuse." In response to such abuse, the United Kingdom has
    used "malicious communication" policies that address the targeting
    and harassment of trans people online, among other issues.

- abstract: "This essay explores what the \"alt-right\" (White
    ethnonationalist, fascist, misogynistic, and anti-intellectual
    communities) means for social media researchers in terms of research
    ethics, risk, and visibility. First, it outlines how #Gamergate and
    #OperationDiggingDiGRA indicated that academic researchers could be
    targets of their hostility. This essay then draws on the work of
    Foucault and Mulvey to theorize how far-right groups have a kind of
    \"gaze.\" Then, it discusses how far-right extremism requires
    rethinking ethical questions around researchers and participants.
    Finally, some thoughts are offered as to what this means for how
    individuals, organizations, disciplines, and institutions can
    support research into these spaces."

- abstract: \"Placing space and place at the center of its analysis
    enables Hate in the Homeland to focus on hate groups and far right
    extremism not only as static, organized movements but also as flows
    of youth who move in and out of the periphery and interstitial
    spaces of far right scenes, rather than only studying youth at the
    definable or fixed core of far right extremist movements. For
    many-perhaps even most-far right youth, Miller-Idriss argues that
    extremist engagement is characterized by a process of moving in and
    out of far right scenes throughout their adolescence and adulthood
    in ways that scholars and policymakers have yet to understand. Hate
    in the Homeland will make a critical intervention into the
    literature on extremism by showing how youth on the margins are
    mobilized through flexible engagements in mainstream-style physical
    and virtual spaces which the far right has actively targeted for
    this purpose. This approach to far right extremism and
    radicalization significantly broadens what we know about the far
    right, and how people engage with it\"--

- abstract: \"Recent years have seen a revival of the heated culture
    wars of the 1990s, but this time its battle ground is the internet.
    On one side the alt right ranges from the once obscure
    neo-reactionary and white separatist movements, to geeky subcultures
    like 4chan, to more mainstream manifestations such as the
    Trump-supporting gay libertarian Milo Yiannopolous. On the other
    side, a culture of struggle sessions and virtue signalling lurks
    behind a therapeutic language of trigger warnings and safe spaces.
    The feminist side of the online culture wars has its equally geeky
    subcultures right through to its mainstream expression. Kill All
    Normies explores some of the cultural genealogies and past parallels
    of these styles and subcultures, drawing from transgressive styles
    of 60s libertinism and conservative movements, to make the case for
    a rejection of the perpetual cultural turn\"--back cover

- abstract: This review focuses on papers on Hate Speech, particularly
    in legal and communication studies indexed in Web of Science. It
    analyzes output published in English and in Spanish as well as
    surveys the predominant disciplines in which these studies are
    written, their trend over time, by country, and type of document.
    This research is extended to determine the debates, lines of work of
    greatest interest, and the theories elaborated. The legal literature
    is intended to define hate speech and hate crime for the purposes of
    applying criminal sanctions. From the communication standpoint, the
    analysis of hate speech in the media is key to understanding the
    type of message used, its emitter, the way in which the message
    rallies supporters, and how they interpret the message. Spanish
    studies mostly fall within the legal area, in which they focus on
    cases of insult directed at the Catholic religion. We discuss the
    importance of interdisciplinarity and transversality and propose a
    mapping of hate speech that lends itself to comparisons between
    countries to assess measures to counteract their effects.

    insight in Women's Studies (NWSA Journal, Spring 1998), I wanted to
    explore further some questions concerning methodology: how does
    Women's Studies cross disciplinary borders in order to construct
    ways of thinking in feminist analytic terms; might Women's Studies
    develop an interdisciplinary methodology of its own; and from what
    base in feminist theory might we do so. In the article that follows,
    I build on the work of Israeli feminist theorist Nira Yuval-Davis to
    construct a model for feminist interdisciplinary thinking based on
    transversalism."

    adolescent disparity estimates based on data from self-administered
    questionnaires (SAQs). Mischievous responders affect a wide range of
    disparity estimates, including those between adoptees and
    nonadoptees, sexual minorities and nonminorities, and individuals
    with and without disabilities. Thus, the procedures introduced here
    have broad relevance to research and can be widely, and easily,
    implemented. The sensitivity-analysis procedures are illustrated
    with SAQ data from youths in Grades 9--12 ( N = 11,829) to examine
    between-group disparities based on sexual identity, gender identity,
    and physical disability. Sensitivity analyses revealed that each
    disparity estimated with these data was extremely sensitive to the
    presence of potentially mischievous responders. Patterns were
    similar across multiple approaches to dealing with mischievous
    responders, across various outcomes, and across different
    between-group comparisons. Mischievous responders are ubiquitous in
    adolescent research using SAQs and can, even in small numbers, lead
    to inaccurate conclusions that substantively affect research,
    policy, and public discourse regarding a variety of disparities.
    This article calls attention to this widespread problem and provides
    practical suggestions for assessing it, even when data are already
    collected.

- abstract: "\\\" Video games have long been seen as the exclusive
    territory of young, heterosexual white males. In a media landscape
    dominated by such gamers, players who do not fit this mold,
    including women, people of color, and LGBT people, are often
    brutalized in forums and in public channels in online play.
    Discussion of representation of such groups in games has frequently
    been limited and cursory. In contrast, Gaming at the Edge builds on
    feminist, queer, and postcolonial theories of identity and draws on
    qualitative audience research methods to make sense of how
    representation comes to matter. In Gaming at the Edge, Adrienne Shaw
    argues that video game players experience race, gender, and
    sexuality concurrently. She asks: How do players identify with
    characters? How do they separate identification and interactivity?
    What is the role of fantasy in representation? What is the
    importance of understanding market logic? In addressing these
    questions Shaw reveals how representation comes to matter to
    participants and offers a perceptive consideration of the high
    stakes in politics of representation debates. Putting forth a
    framework for talking about representation, difference, and
    diversity in an era in which user-generated content, individualized
    media consumption, and the blurring of producer/consumer roles has
    lessened the utility of traditional models of media representation
    analysis, Shaw finds new insight on the edge of media consumption
    with the invisible, marginalized gamers who are surprising in both
    their numbers and their influence in mainstream gamer culture. \\\"--"

- abstract: "Stereotypes reduce women's identification with science,
    technology, engineering, and math (STEM), which can decrease their
    motivation to enter STEM domains. Stereotypes may be gender-based
    (e.g., STEM is for men) or trait-based (e.g., STEM is for geniuses).
    In this study, I explored two primary research questions: First,
    would stereotyping STEM as a domain for nerdy geniuses negatively
    relate to women's STEM identity? Second, would STEM identity mediate
    the relation between stereotypes and STEM motivation? Nerd-genius
    stereotypes and gender stereotypes negatively contributed to women's
    STEM identity. STEM identity positively contributed to women's STEM
    motivation (including expectancy-value beliefs). Participants were a
    diverse sample of undergraduate women ( N = 195, mean age was 19.8;
    30% of participants were Latina, 30% European, 24% Asian).
    Stereotype measures were (1) implicit gender-STEM associations, (2)
    explicit gender associations about STEM, and (3) a new scale that
    measured nerd-genius stereotypes. The results highlight the unique
    contribution different stereotypes make toward women's
    identification with STEM and, in turn, their motivation to pursue
    STEM pathways. Practice implications include addressing nerd-genius
    stereotypes in STEM interventions and reducing classroom artifacts
    that might be reminiscent of these stereotypes."

- abstract: According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey,
    transgender students in K-12 settings experience high rates of
    harassment (78 percent), physical assault (35 percent), and even
    sexual violence (12 percent). In response to the mounting evidence
    of discrimination, the Obama administration in May 2016 issued a
    \"Dear Colleague\" letter, authored jointly by the Departments of
    Justice and Education, extending sex discrimination protections to
    transgender students--an interpretation of Title IX that was
    reversed by the Trump administration in February 2017. Many of these
    transgender students matriculate at colleges and universities across
    the country. What do we know about their background, experiences,
    and expectations? To explore this question, the authors conducted an
    analysis of data from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program
    (CIRP) Freshman Survey, which was modified in 2015 to allow students
    to indicate whether they identify as transgender. That change
    enabled them to disaggregate data for a sample of incoming
    first-year students consisting of 678 transgender students from 209
    colleges and universities. They compared these data to the national
    norms for all incoming first-time, full-time college
    students--including the transgender students, who comprise less than
    one half of one percent of the total. To develop a holistic picture
    and to avoid a deficit framing, the authors took care in their
    analysis to present examples of experiences that demonstrate how
    transgender students exercise agency over their needs and their
    lives, in addition to examples of areas where these students fare
    worse than incoming students overall.

- abstract: Although online racism occurs frequently and explicitly in
    online gaming (e.g., anti-Black hate speeches), no research has
    examined the psychological impact on racial/ethnic minority players.
    Thus, the current study examined the mediating role of online racism
    in the link between time spent in online gaming and psychological
    distress. Using data from 765 racial minority emerging adults in the
    United States and with gender controlled, time spent in online
    gaming predicted greater exposure to online racism, which in turn
    was linked to higher psychological distress. Post hoc multi-group
    comparison suggested that the findings were consistent with the
    Black group but neither the direct nor indirect effects of the model
    were significant for the Asian and Latinx groups. The results
    highlight the unjust digital burden and psychological costs of
    racism in online gaming among racial minority emerging adults,
    particularly among Black individuals. Limitations and implications
    for research are discussed.

- abstract: A general inductive approach for analysis of qualitative
    evaluation data is described. The purposes for using an inductive
    approach are to (a) condense raw textual data into a brief, summary
    format; (b) establish clear links between the evaluation or research
    objectives and the summary findings derived from the raw data; and
    (c) develop a framework of the underlying structure of experiences
    or processes that are evident in the raw data. The general inductive
    approach provides an easily used and systematic set of procedures
    for analyzing qualitative data that can produce reliable and valid
    findings. Although the general inductive approach is not as strong
    as some other analytic strategies for theory or model development,
    it does provide a simple, straightforward approach for deriving
    findings in the context of focused evaluation questions. Many
    evaluators are likely to find using a general inductive approach
    less complicated than using other approaches to qualitative data
    analysis.

- abstract: "\\\"A short, literary, powerful contemplation on how Jews are
    viewed in America since the election of Donald J. Trump, and how we
    can move forward to fight anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism has always
    been present in American culture, but with the rise of the Alt Right
    and an uptick of threats to Jewish communities since Trump took
    office, New York Times editor Jonathan Weisman has produced a book
    that could not be more important or timely. When Weisman was
    attacked on Twitter by a wave of neo-Nazis and anti-Semites,
    witnessing tropes such as the Jew as a leftist anarchist; as a
    rapacious, Wall Street profiteer; and as a money-bags financier
    orchestrating war for Israel, he stopped to wonder: How has the
    Jewish experience changed, especially under a leader like Donald
    Trump? In (((Semitism))), Weisman will explore the disconnect
    between his own sense of Jewish identity and the expectations of his
    detractors and supporters. He will delve into the rise of the Alt
    Right, their roots in older anti-Semitic organizations, the odd
    ancientness of their grievances--cloaked as they are in
    contemporary, techy hipsterism--and their aims--to spread hate in a
    palatable way through a political structure that has so suddenly
    become tolerant of their views. He will conclude with what we should
    do next, realizing that vicious as it is, anti-Semitism must be seen
    through the lens of more pressing threats. He proposes a unification
    of American Judaism around the defense of self and of others even
    more vulnerable: the undocumented immigrants, refugees, Muslim
    Americans, and black activists who have been directly targeted, not
    just by the tolerated Alt Right, but by the Trump White House
    itself\\\"--"

- abstract: While research focusing on friendships of sexual minority
    individuals has increased over the last two decades, studies of
    transgender persons' friendships have been largely absent. Yet,
    within mainstream literature it has been demonstrated that
    friendships are central both to identity formation and as support in
    terms of psychological need and distress. Given that trans people
    face important identity challenges and may well be disenfranchised
    within society, the role of friendships warrants study. Research
    which has occurred has largely focussed on trans women, yet trans
    men face particular issues in terms of their relationships with
    lesbian women and being positioned as joining patriarchy. This study
    explored this gap in the literature and used Foucauldian discourse
    analysis to explore friendship and gender identity. Dominant
    discourses identified included 'friends as family', 'romance' and
    discursive practices of 'disowning male privilege', 'effeminate
    heterosexual male' and 'gender fluidity' which counter hegemonic
    (trans) male re-positioning within friendships. The results indicate
    that trans men elevate the status of friends to those of other
    culturally dominant relationships (e.g. family or sexual partner).
    Furthermore, their friendships, in particular friendships with
    lesbian women, can become complex platforms from which to contest
    privilege and power associated with their (trans) masculinities.
    Conceptual and research implications are discussed.
