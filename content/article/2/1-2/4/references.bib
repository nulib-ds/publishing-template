	abstract = {Is queer social science possible? Early queer theorists disparaged empiricism as a normalizing, modernist discourse. Nonetheless, LGBTQI+ social scientists have applied queer concepts in empirical projects. Rather than seek a queer method, we ask, Is there an empirical perspective that (ontologically) envisions social relations more queerly—attending to discursive and materialist productions of reality? Dorothy Smith’s work foregrounds people’s activities of engaging texts and satisfies Black queer studies’ and new materialisms’ critiques of early queer theory. Underutilized and often misread, especially its ethnomethodological sensibilities and its vision of actors as relational, practical actors, her work shows how my race is not mine, it is ours; your sexual orientation is not yours, it is ours; their gender is not theirs, it is ours. Smith offers an ontology without essence, grand theory, or normativity, facilitating a range of queer, interpretive projects—from the intersectional to the transnational to the embodied.},

Facing a world of outrageous injustice, Davis challenges us to imagine and build the movement for human liberation. And in doing so, she reminds us that "Freedom is a constant struggle."},

We provide a framework for understanding the types of harassers that target researchers, the harassment that ensues, and the personal and professional impact on individuals and academic freedom. We then study preventative and remedial strategies available, and the institutions that prevent some of these strategies from being more effective. Finally, we discuss the ethical structures that could facilitate more equitable access to participating in research without serious personal suffering.},

	title = {The right is dominating {Facebook} engagement on content about trans issues},
	url = {https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/right-dominating-facebook-engagement-content-about-trans-issues},
	abstract = {A Media Matters study of interactions (reactions, comments, shares) on published online content about trans topics shared on Facebook found that right-leaning sources earned considerably higher engagement than all other sources combined. This study comes after Media Matters has extensively and repeatedly debunked allegations of a bias against right-wing content on Facebook. Despite this, Facebook has consistently caved to conservative demands. It has granted conservatives top positions at the company, included right-wing Breitbart News in a list of trusted news sources, met with right-wing media personalities like Tucker Carlson, and allowed the “trending” function to be taken over by an algorithm that often promotes false, partisan right-wing news. We looked at 225 pieces of high-performing content on trans topics -- articles, blog posts, videos -- which earned a combined total of nearly 66 million interactions on Facebook. Content about trans people and related topics from right-leaning sources constituted 65.7\% of those interactions. Comparatively, 15.4\% of all interactions were earned by content from queer sources, 3.9\% from left-leaning sources, 10.4\% from nonaligned sources, and 4.6\% from "other" sources. In particular, content from right-leaning sources about trans athletes and about medical care for trans folks, specifically trans youth, earned high engagement, and right-wing outlets The Daily Wire and LifeSiteNews published more high-performing Facebook content about trans issues than any other outlets.  This has consequences. Millions of Americans get their news from Facebook and other social media platforms; Pew Research Center found that 52\% of Americans get news on Facebook. Media Matters’ analysis of trans-related content shared on Facebook shows that those Americans are often getting biased, bigoted, and misinformative news. This content directly harms public discourse and policy surrounding trans folks.  Furthermore, this discourse has undoubtedly led to the online harassment and abuse of trans people, who have been victims of doxxing -- the act of publishing a person’s private or personal information, including address or location. In fact, according to a 2019 Forbes report, “12\% of all conversations about being trans contain abuse.” In response to such abuse, the United Kingdom has used “malicious communication” policies that address the targeting and harassment of trans people online, among other issues.},

This essay then draws on the work of Foucault and Mulvey to theorize how far-right groups have a kind of “gaze.” Then, it discusses how far-right extremism requires rethinking ethical questions around researchers and participants. Finally, some thoughts are offered as to what this means for how individuals, organizations, disciplines, and institutions can support research into these spaces.},

For many-perhaps even most-far right youth, Miller-Idriss argues that extremist engagement is characterized by a process of moving in and out of far right scenes throughout their adolescence and adulthood in ways that scholars and policymakers have yet to understand. Hate in the Homeland will make a critical intervention into the literature on extremism by showing how youth on the margins are mobilized through flexible engagements in mainstream-style physical and virtual spaces which the far right has actively targeted for this purpose. This approach to far right extremism and radicalization significantly broadens what we know about the far right, and how people engage with it"--},

The feminist side of the online culture wars has its equally geeky subcultures right through to its mainstream expression.

This research is extended to determine the debates, lines of work of greatest interest, and the theories elaborated. The legal literature is intended to define hate speech and hate crime for the purposes of applying criminal sanctions. From the communication standpoint, the analysis of hate speech in the media is key to understanding the type of message used, its emitter, the way in which the message rallies supporters, and how they interpret the message. Spanish studies mostly fall within the legal area, in which they focus on cases of insult directed at the Catholic religion. We discuss the importance of interdisciplinarity and transversality and propose a mapping of hate speech that lends itself to comparisons between countries to assess measures to counteract their effects.},

	abstract = {This article introduces novel sensitivity-analysis procedures for investigating and reducing the bias that mischievous responders (i.e., youths who provide extreme, and potentially untruthful, responses to multiple questions) often introduce in adolescent disparity estimates based on data from self-administered questionnaires (SAQs). Mischievous responders affect a wide range of disparity estimates, including those between adoptees and nonadoptees, sexual minorities and nonminorities, and individuals with and without disabilities. Thus, the procedures introduced here have broad relevance to research and can be widely, and easily, implemented. The sensitivity-analysis procedures are illustrated with SAQ data from youths in Grades 9–12 ( N = 11,829) to examine between-group disparities based on sexual identity, gender identity, and physical disability. Sensitivity analyses revealed that each disparity estimated with these data was extremely sensitive to the presence of potentially mischievous responders. Patterns were similar across multiple approaches to dealing with mischievous responders, across various outcomes, and across different between-group comparisons. Mischievous responders are ubiquitous in adolescent research using SAQs and can, even in small numbers, lead to inaccurate conclusions that substantively affect research, policy, and public discourse regarding a variety of disparities. This article calls attention to this widespread problem and provides practical suggestions for assessing it, even when data are already collected.},

In a media landscape dominated by such gamers, players who do not fit this mold, including women, people of color, and LGBT people, are often brutalized in forums and in public channels in online play. Discussion of representation of such groups in games has frequently been limited and cursory. In contrast, Gaming at the Edge builds on feminist, queer, and postcolonial theories of identity and draws on qualitative audience research methods to make sense of how representation comes to matter. In Gaming at the Edge, Adrienne Shaw argues that video game players experience race, gender, and sexuality concurrently. She asks: How do players identify with characters? How do they separate identification and interactivity? What is the role of fantasy in representation? What is the importance of understanding market logic? In addressing these questions Shaw reveals how representation comes to matter to participants and offers a perceptive consideration of the high stakes in politics of representation debates. Putting forth a framework for talking about representation, difference, and diversity in an era in which user-generated content, individualized media consumption, and the blurring of producer/consumer roles has lessened the utility of traditional models of media representation analysis, Shaw finds new insight on the edge of media consumption with the invisible, marginalized gamers who are surprising in both their numbers and their influence in mainstream gamer culture.

Stereotypes may be gender-based (e.g., STEM is for men) or trait-based (e.g., STEM is for geniuses). In this study, I explored two primary research questions: First, would stereotyping STEM as a domain for nerdy geniuses negatively relate to women’s STEM identity? Second, would STEM identity mediate the relation between stereotypes and STEM motivation? Nerd-genius stereotypes and gender stereotypes negatively contributed to women’s STEM identity. STEM identity positively contributed to women’s STEM motivation (including expectancy-value beliefs). Participants were a diverse sample of undergraduate women ( N = 195, mean age was 19.8; 30\% of participants were Latina, 30\% European, 24\% Asian). Stereotype measures were (1) implicit gender-STEM associations, (2) explicit gender associations about STEM, and (3) a new scale that measured nerd-genius stereotypes. The results highlight the unique contribution different stereotypes make toward women’s identification with STEM and, in turn, their motivation to pursue STEM pathways. Practice implications include addressing nerd-genius stereotypes in STEM interventions and reducing classroom artifacts that might be reminiscent of these stereotypes.},

	abstract = {According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, transgender students in K-12 settings experience high rates of harassment (78 percent), physical assault (35 percent), and even sexual violence (12 percent). In response to the mounting evidence of discrimination, the Obama administration in May 2016 issued a "Dear Colleague" letter, authored jointly by the Departments of Justice and Education, extending sex discrimination protections to transgender students--an interpretation of Title IX that was reversed by the Trump administration in February 2017. Many of these transgender students matriculate at colleges and universities across the country. What do we know about their background, experiences, and expectations? To explore this question, the authors conducted an analysis of data from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) Freshman Survey, which was modified in 2015 to allow students to indicate whether they identify as transgender. That change enabled them to disaggregate data for a sample of incoming first-year students consisting of 678 transgender students from 209 colleges and universities. They compared these data to the national norms for all incoming first-time, full-time college students--including the transgender students, who comprise less than one half of one percent of the total. To develop a holistic picture and to avoid a deficit framing, the authors took care in their analysis to present examples of experiences that demonstrate how transgender students exercise agency over their needs and their lives, in addition to examples of areas where these students fare worse than incoming students overall.},

Using data from 765 racial minority emerging adults in the United States and with gender controlled, time spent in online gaming predicted greater exposure to online racism, which in turn was linked to higher psychological distress. Post hoc multi-group comparison suggested that the findings were consistent with the Black group but neither the direct nor indirect effects of the model were significant for the Asian and Latinx groups. The results highlight the unjust digital burden and psychological costs of racism in online gaming among racial minority emerging adults, particularly among Black individuals.

The general inductive approach provides an easily used and systematic set of procedures for analyzing qualitative data that can produce reliable and valid findings. Although the general inductive approach is not as strong as some other analytic strategies for theory or model development, it does provide a simple, straightforward approach for deriving findings in the context of focused evaluation questions.

Anti-Semitism has always been present in American culture, but with the rise of the Alt Right and an uptick of threats to Jewish communities since Trump took office, New York Times editor Jonathan Weisman has produced a book that could not be more important or timely. When Weisman was attacked on Twitter by a wave of neo-Nazis and anti-Semites, witnessing tropes such as the Jew as a leftist anarchist; as a rapacious, Wall Street profiteer; and as a money-bags financier orchestrating war for Israel, he stopped to wonder: How has the Jewish experience changed, especially under a leader like Donald Trump? In (((Semitism))), Weisman will explore the disconnect between his own sense of Jewish identity and the expectations of his detractors and supporters. He will delve into the rise of the Alt Right, their roots in older anti-Semitic organizations, the odd ancientness of their grievances--cloaked as they are in contemporary, techy hipsterism--and their aims--to spread hate in a palatable way through a political structure that has so suddenly become tolerant of their views. He will conclude with what we should do next, realizing that vicious as it is, anti-Semitism must be seen through the lens of more pressing threats. He proposes a unification of American Judaism around the defense of self and of others even more vulnerable: the undocumented immigrants, refugees, Muslim Americans, and black activists who have been directly targeted, not just by the tolerated Alt Right, but by the Trump White House itself"--},

	abstract = {While research focusing on friendships of sexual minority individuals has increased over the last two decades, studies of transgender persons’ friendships have been largely absent. Yet, within mainstream literature it has been demonstrated that friendships are central both to identity formation and as support in terms of psychological need and distress. Given that trans people face important identity challenges and may well be disenfranchised within society, the role of friendships warrants study. Research which has occurred has largely focussed on trans women, yet trans men face particular issues in terms of their relationships with lesbian women and being positioned as joining patriarchy. This study explored this gap in the literature and used Foucauldian discourse analysis to explore friendship and gender identity. Dominant discourses identified included ‘friends as family’, ‘romance’ and discursive practices of ‘disowning male privilege’, ‘effeminate heterosexual male’ and ‘gender fluidity’ which counter hegemonic (trans) male re-positioning within friendships. The results indicate that trans men elevate the status of friends to those of other culturally dominant relationships (e.g. family or sexual partner). Furthermore, their friendships, in particular friendships with lesbian women, can become complex platforms from which to contest privilege and power associated with their (trans) masculinities. Conceptual and research implications are discussed.},
