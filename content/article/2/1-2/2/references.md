- abstract: \"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
    Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), is the most comprehensive,
    current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to
    today's mental health clinicians and researchers. DSM-5-TR includes
    fully revised text and references, updated diagnostic criteria and
    ICD-10-CM codes since DSM-5 was published in 2013. It features a new
    disorder, prolonged grief disorder, as well as codes for suicidal
    behavior available to all clinicians of any discipline without the
    requirement of any other diagnosis. With contributions from over 200
    subject matter experts, this updated volume boasts the most current
    text updates based on the scientific literature. Now in four-color
    and with the ability to authenticate each printed copy, DSM-5-TR
    provides a cohesive, updated presentation of criteria, diagnostic
    codes, and text. This latest volume offers a common language for
    clinicians involved in the diagnosis and study of mental disorders
    and facilitates an objective assessment of symptom presentations
    across a variety of clinical settings-inpatient, outpatient, partial
    hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and
    primary care. Important updates in DSM-5-TR include 1) fully revised
    text for each disorder with updated sections on associated features,
    prevalence, development and course, risk and prognostic factors,
    culture, diagnostic markers, suicide, differential diagnosis, and
    more; 2) addition of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) to Section II;
    3) over 70 modified criteria sets with helpful clarifications since
    publication of DSM-5; 4) fully updated Introduction and Use of the
    Manual to guide usage and provide context for important terminology;
    5) considerations of the impact of racism and discrimination on
    mental disorders integrated into the text; 6) new codes to flag and
    monitor suicidal behavior, available to all clinicians of any
    discipline and without the requirement of any other diagnosis; 7)
    fully updated ICD-10-CM codes implemented since 2013, including over
    50 coding updates new to DSM-5-TR for substance intoxication and
    withdrawal and other disorders\"--

- abstract: Objectives. We examined the independent demographic and
    psychosocial factors associated with psychological distress and
    resilience among transgender men and women. Methods. Our data came
    from an online survey involving a national Australian sample of 169
    transgender men and women in 2011. Survey questions assessed
    demographics; sources of support; contact with lesbian, gay,
    bisexual, and transgender peers; and experiences of victimization.
    We assessed the outcomes with the Kessler Psychological Distress
    Scale and the Brief Resilience Scale. Results. In all, 46.0% of the
    sample reported high or very high levels of psychological distress.
    Multivariable regression analyses identified considerably different
    independent factors for psychological distress and resilience.
    Younger age, feeling unable to turn to family for support, and
    victimization experiences were associated with greater psychological
    distress, whereas higher income, identifying as heterosexual, and
    having frequent contact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
    peers were associated with greater resilience. Conclusions. With
    different factors identified for psychological distress and
    resilience, these findings may help inform the development of
    tailored mental health interventions and resilience-building
    programs for this vulnerable population.

- abstract: Objectives. We assessed the association between minority
    stress, mental health, and potential ameliorating factors in a
    large, community-based, geographically diverse sample of the US
    transgender population. Methods. In 2003, we recruited through the
    Internet a sample of 1093 male-to-female and female-to-male
    transgender persons, stratified by gender. Participants completed an
    online survey that included standardized measures of mental health.
    Guided by the minority stress model, we evaluated associations
    between stigma and mental health and tested whether indicators of
    resilience (family support, peer support, identity pride) moderated
    these associations. Results. Respondents had a high prevalence of
    clinical depression (44.1%), anxiety (33.2%), and somatization
    (27.5%). Social stigma was positively associated with psychological
    distress. Peer support (from other transgender people) moderated
    this relationship. We found few differences by gender identity.
    Conclusions. Our findings support the minority stress model.
    Prevention needs to confront social structures, norms, and attitudes
    that produce minority stress for gender-variant people; enhance peer
    support; and improve access to mental health and social services
    that affirm transgender identity and promote resilience.

- abstract: This article contributes to the burgeoning literatures on
    the sociology of diagnosis and transgender studies by examining the
    relationship between diagnostic processes and the legitimation of
    gender identity---the medicalization of transgender people. In order
    for trans-identified people to access medical and surgical services,
    they must submit to a complex mental health diagnostic process that
    relies on criteria set by the American Psychiatric Association and
    the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH). By
    focusing on provider experiences of using the Gender Identity
    Disorder (GID) diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of
    Mental Health Disorders, Fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR)
    to meet the requirements of WPATH's Standards of Care (SOC-6), we
    show that diagnostic processes can both support and inhibit a
    transpatient's abilities to access services. Participants reveal how
    deeply held cultural views pertaining to gender, mental health, and
    patient competency are entrenched in diagnostic categories. While
    the new DSM-5 has relabeled GID as Gender Dysphoria and the SOC-7
    has somewhat lessened the requirements for accessing hormone
    treatments, our data suggest that these changes will not be enough
    to alter the underlying structure of social control and power that
    diagnostic categories have over transpeople and their providers.

- abstract: "Many LGBTQ+ people face significant physical and mental
    health, social, and economic disparities, disparities that have been
    exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent qualitative and
    quantitative research has explored some of the specific ways that
    LGBTQ+ people have been developing and using resilience strategies
    during the pandemic, but little is currently known regarding
    specific pandemic-related stressors unique to LGBTQ+ individuals,
    social support networks and community resilience developed by LGBTQ+
    individuals, and accessibility of both LGBTQ+-specific and general
    healthcare needs. The present study was conducted to help address
    these gaps in the current research literature. As part of a larger
    online survey on LGBTQ+ people and the impacts of COVID-19,
    participants (N = 220) were asked a series of open-ended questions
    about their general and identity-specific concerns, forms of coping,
    and forms of social support accessed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Using the consensual qualitative research modified method (CQR-M),
    31 subdomains grouped under seven main domains were revealed: (1)

    maintenance and planning ; (4) concerns for close others ; (5)
    source of connection ; (6) connection format ; and (7) LGBTQ+
    affirmative care . The findings in the present study expand research
    and health provider understanding of unique forms of distress,
    coping, social support, and community resilience experienced and
    engaged in by LGBTQ+ people during the COVID-19 pandemic. These
    qualitative findings can help inform more targeted interventions at
    individual, community, and public policy levels."

- abstract: Imagine that you are conducting a large online quantitative
    survey of countertransference management strategies used by
    therapists in training. In addition to the quantitative measures
    included in the survey, you decide to add a single open-ended
    question asking participants to describe components of their unique
    clinical experiences that were not captured by the measures in the
    survey (e.g., \"How do specific client characteristics or presenting
    issues relate to your unresolved issues?\"). The written responses
    obtained from your 300 participants contain three or four sentences
    each and are relatively straightforward and easy to understand.
    Constructing core ideas as you would for a traditional consensual
    qualitative research (CQR) analysis seems excessive because the
    comments are already succinct and there is no context to consider. A
    briefer alternative to CQR that would produce domains and categories
    consensually derived from the data would be useful, but you are
    unsure of how to structure the coding teams, code the data, report
    the results, or discuss the qualitative findings within the context
    of the overall study. Fortunately, consensual qualitative
    research---modified (CQR-M) allows you to do just this task. This
    chapter provides a brief definition and background of CQR-M followed
    by a rationale for using CQR-M. We then provide a step-by-step guide
    to conducting CQR-M analyses. We begin with design considerations,
    including determining the purpose of the qualitative data and the
    issue of sample size. Next are steps for data collection, followed
    by steps for recruiting and training judges. We then describe the
    procedures for analyzing brief qualitative data, including
    development of domains and categories, and the consensual coding
    process. Finally, we provide some guidance for writing up CQR-M
    results and discussion sections. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019

- abstract: Some transgender people in the USA actively experience
    changes in institutional power linked to transitioning. As such,
    they serve as informants to the interconnections of institutional
    inequalities and social identities and positions. Centering the
    experiences of "trans" people of color and drawing from feminist
    standpoint theory, I theorize a multifaceted prism to expand upon
    existing intersectional models by linking multifaceted social
    positions to institutional inequalities and challenging dichotomous
    understandings of categories. I then use this multifaceted prism to
    critique my own positionality as a researcher and to analyze
    experiences of trans people of color.
