	abstract = {"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers. DSM-5-TR includes fully revised text and references, updated diagnostic criteria and ICD-10-CM codes since DSM-5 was published in 2013. It features a new disorder, prolonged grief disorder, as well as codes for suicidal behavior available to all clinicians of any discipline without the requirement of any other diagnosis. With contributions from over 200 subject matter experts, this updated volume boasts the most current text updates based on the scientific literature. Now in four-color and with the ability to authenticate each printed copy, DSM-5-TR provides a cohesive, updated presentation of criteria, diagnostic codes, and text. This latest volume offers a common language for clinicians involved in the diagnosis and study of mental disorders and facilitates an objective assessment of symptom presentations across a variety of clinical settings-inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. Important updates in DSM-5-TR include 1) fully revised text for each disorder with updated sections on associated features, prevalence, development and course, risk and prognostic factors, culture, diagnostic markers, suicide, differential diagnosis, and more; 2) addition of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) to Section II; 3) over 70 modified criteria sets with helpful clarifications since publication of DSM-5; 4) fully updated Introduction and Use of the Manual to guide usage and provide context for important terminology; 5) considerations of the impact of racism and discrimination on mental disorders integrated into the text; 6) new codes to flag and monitor suicidal behavior, available to all clinicians of any discipline and without the requirement of any other diagnosis; 7) fully updated ICD-10-CM codes implemented since 2013, including over 50 coding updates new to DSM-5-TR for substance intoxication and withdrawal and other disorders"--},

	abstract = {Objectives. We examined the independent demographic and psychosocial factors associated with psychological distress and resilience among transgender men and women.
            Methods. Our data came from an online survey involving a national Australian sample of 169 transgender men and women in 2011. Survey questions assessed demographics; sources of support; contact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender peers; and experiences of victimization. We assessed the outcomes with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and the Brief Resilience Scale.
            Results. In all, 46.0\% of the sample reported high or very high levels of psychological distress. Multivariable regression analyses identified considerably different independent factors for psychological distress and resilience. Younger age, feeling unable to turn to family for support, and victimization experiences were associated with greater psychological distress, whereas higher income, identifying as heterosexual, and having frequent contact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender peers were associated with greater resilience.
            Conclusions. With different factors identified for psychological distress and resilience, these findings may help inform the development of tailored mental health interventions and resilience-building programs for this vulnerable population.},

	abstract = {Objectives. We assessed the association between minority stress, mental health, and potential ameliorating factors in a large, community-based, geographically diverse sample of the US transgender population.
            Methods. In 2003, we recruited through the Internet a sample of 1093 male-to-female and female-to-male transgender persons, stratified by gender. Participants completed an online survey that included standardized measures of mental health. Guided by the minority stress model, we evaluated associations between stigma and mental health and tested whether indicators of resilience (family support, peer support, identity pride) moderated these associations.
            Results. Respondents had a high prevalence of clinical depression (44.1\%), anxiety (33.2\%), and somatization (27.5\%). Social stigma was positively associated with psychological distress. Peer support (from other transgender people) moderated this relationship. We found few differences by gender identity.
            Conclusions. Our findings support the minority stress model. Prevention needs to confront social structures, norms, and attitudes that produce minority stress for gender-variant people; enhance peer support; and improve access to mental health and social services that affirm transgender identity and promote resilience.},

	abstract = {This article contributes to the burgeoning literatures on the sociology of diagnosis and transgender studies by examining the relationship between diagnostic processes and the legitimation of gender identity—the medicalization of transgender people. In order for trans-identified people to access medical and surgical services, they must submit to a complex mental health diagnostic process that relies on criteria set by the American Psychiatric Association and the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH). By focusing on provider experiences of using the Gender Identity Disorder (GID) diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, Fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) to meet the requirements of WPATH’s Standards of Care (SOC-6), we show that diagnostic processes can both support and inhibit a transpatient’s abilities to access services. Participants reveal how deeply held cultural views pertaining to gender, mental health, and patient competency are entrenched in diagnostic categories. While the new DSM-5 has relabeled GID as Gender Dysphoria and the SOC-7 has somewhat lessened the requirements for accessing hormone treatments, our data suggest that these changes will not be enough to alter the underlying structure of social control and power that diagnostic categories have over transpeople and their providers.},

	abstract = {Many LGBTQ+ people face significant physical and mental health, social, and economic disparities, disparities that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent qualitative and quantitative research has explored some of the specific ways that LGBTQ+ people have been developing and using resilience strategies during the pandemic, but little is currently known regarding specific pandemic-related stressors unique to LGBTQ+ individuals, social support networks and community resilience developed by LGBTQ+ individuals, and accessibility of both LGBTQ+-specific and general healthcare needs. The present study was conducted to help address these gaps in the current research literature. As part of a larger online survey on LGBTQ+ people and the impacts of COVID-19, participants (N = 220) were asked a series of open-ended questions about their general and identity-specific concerns, forms of coping, and forms of social support accessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the consensual qualitative research modified method (CQR-M), 31 subdomains grouped under seven main domains were revealed: (1)
              societal orientation
              ; (2)
              personal worries
              ; (3)
              personal maintenance and planning
              ; (4)
              concerns for close others
              ; (5)

              ; (6)
              connection format
              ; and (7)
              LGBTQ+ affirmative care
              . The findings in the present study expand research and health provider understanding of unique forms of distress, coping, social support, and community resilience experienced and engaged in by LGBTQ+ people during the COVID-19 pandemic. These qualitative findings can help inform more targeted interventions at individual, community, and public policy levels.},

	shorttitle = {Consensual qualitative research for simple qualitative data},
	abstract = {Imagine that you are conducting a large online quantitative survey of countertransference management strategies used by therapists in training. In addition to the quantitative measures included in the survey, you decide to add a single open-ended question asking participants to describe components of their unique clinical experiences that were not captured by the measures in the survey (e.g., "How do specific client characteristics or presenting issues relate to your unresolved issues?"). The written responses obtained from your 300 participants contain three or four sentences each and are relatively straightforward and easy to understand. Constructing core ideas as you would for a traditional consensual qualitative research (CQR) analysis seems excessive because the comments are already succinct and there is no context to consider. A briefer alternative to CQR that would produce domains and categories consensually derived from the data would be useful, but you are unsure of how to structure the coding teams, code the data, report the results, or discuss the qualitative findings within the context of the overall study. Fortunately, consensual qualitative research—modified (CQR-M) allows you to do just this task. This chapter provides a brief definition and background of CQR-M followed by a rationale for using CQR-M. We then provide a step-by-step guide to conducting CQR-M analyses. We begin with design considerations, including determining the purpose of the qualitative data and the issue of sample size. Next are steps for data collection, followed by steps for recruiting and training judges. We then describe the procedures for analyzing brief qualitative data, including development of domains and categories, and the consensual coding process. Finally, we provide some guidance for writing up CQR-M results and discussion sections. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},
