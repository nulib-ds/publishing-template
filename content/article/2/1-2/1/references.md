- abstract: Objectives. We assessed the association between minority
    stress, mental health, and potential ameliorating factors in a
    large, community-based, geographically diverse sample of the US
    transgender population. Methods. In 2003, we recruited through the
    Internet a sample of 1093 male-to-female and female-to-male
    transgender persons, stratified by gender. Participants completed an
    online survey that included standardized measures of mental health.
    Guided by the minority stress model, we evaluated associations
    between stigma and mental health and tested whether indicators of
    resilience (family support, peer support, identity pride) moderated
    these associations. Results. Respondents had a high prevalence of
    clinical depression (44.1%), anxiety (33.2%), and somatization
    (27.5%). Social stigma was positively associated with psychological
    distress. Peer support (from other transgender people) moderated
    this relationship. We found few differences by gender identity.
    Conclusions. Our findings support the minority stress model.
    Prevention needs to confront social structures, norms, and attitudes
    that produce minority stress for gender-variant people; enhance peer
    support; and improve access to mental health and social services
    that affirm transgender identity and promote resilience.

- abstract: "The term intersectionality references the critical insight
    that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and
    age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but rather
    as reciprocally constructing phenomena. Despite this general
    consensus, definitions of what counts as intersectionality are far
    from clear. In this article, I analyze intersectionality as a
    knowledge project whose raison d'être lies in its attentiveness to
    power relations and social inequalities. I examine three
    interdependent sets of concerns: (a) intersectionality as a field of
    study that is situated within the power relations that it studies;
    (b) intersectionality as an analytical strategy that provides new
    angles of vision on social phenomena; and (c) intersectionality as
    critical praxis that informs social justice projects."

- abstract: Throughout history, the rights of stigmatized minority group
    members have been subject to popular debate and voter referenda. The
    impact of the resulting devaluing social discourse on the well-being
    of minority group members remains unknown. For example, exposure to
    the discourse leading up to decisions on same-sex marriage may have
    negative consequences for sexual minority individuals and same-sex
    couples. We examined the impact of exposure to same-sex marriage
    campaign messages (e.g., commercials, billboards, yard signs) on the
    psychological and relational well-being of couples living in the
    four states that had same-sex marriage voter initiatives in the 2012
    general election. Sixty-two same-sex couples ( N = 124) completed a
    baseline survey and 10 daily diary reports during the month before
    the election. Daily exposure to negative campaign messages was
    associated with increased negative affect and decreased positive
    affect and relationship satisfaction. These associations persisted
    controlling for baseline levels of depression and daily fluctuations
    in general stress among both members of the couple. Exposure to a
    devaluing social discourse regarding the rights of same-sex couples
    represents a unique form of social stress resulting in negative
    consequences for the psychological and relational well-being of
    same-sex couples. Thus, the health of same-sex couples may be of
    particular concern in contexts where marriage policy decisions are
    pending and the subject of popular debate.

- abstract: Abstract Recent political debate over transgender military
    service and gendered bathroom use highlights a dramatic increase in
    salience over transgender issues in the US. In this essay, we
    examine a potential new front in the culture wars by reviewing
    recent empirical research in social science on the politics of
    transgender rights in the context of morality politics. Research on
    morality politics has often focused on LGBT rights, with an emphasis
    on gay and lesbian rights and little attention to transgender
    issues. We highlight the progress of research on transgender issues
    in the US, focusing on the study of attitudes about transgender
    people and rights, transgender rights in states and localities, and
    broader findings affecting transgender populations. Although there
    is ample research still needed, the current state of empirical
    social science on transgender issues has made great advancements in
    the past decade and shows that morality continues to shape LGBT
    politics and policy.

- abstract: "Objectives. We examined the relation between living in
    states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage during the 2004 and
    2005 elections and the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among
    lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations. Methods. We used data
    from wave 1 (2001--2002) and wave 2 (2004--2005) of the National
    Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 34 653),
    a longitudinal, nationally representative study of
    noninstitutionalized US adults. Results. Psychiatric disorders
    defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
    Disorders, Fourth Edition, increased significantly between waves 1
    and 2 among LGB respondents living in states that banned gay
    marriage for the following outcomes: any mood disorder (36.6%
    increase), generalized anxiety disorder (248.2% increase), any
    alcohol use disorder (41.9% increase), and psychiatric comorbidity
    (36.3% increase). These psychiatric disorders did not increase
    significantly among LGB respondents living in states without
    constitutional amendments. Additionally, we found no evidence for
    increases of the same magnitude among heterosexuals living in states
    with constitutional amendments. Conclusions. Living in states with
    discriminatory policies may have pernicious consequences for the
    mental health of LGB populations. These findings lend scientific
    support to recent efforts to overturn these policies."

- abstract: Research suggests that members of advantaged groups who feel
    dehumanized by other groups respond aggressively. But little is
    known about how meta-dehumanization affects disadvantaged minority
    group members, historically the primary targets of dehumanization.
    We examine this important question in the context of the 2016 U.S.
    Republican Primaries, which have witnessed the widespread derogation
    and dehumanization of Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Two initial
    studies document that Americans blatantly dehumanize Mexican
    immigrants and Muslims; this dehumanization uniquely predicts
    support for aggressive policies proposed by Republican nominees, and
    dehumanization is highly associated with supporting Republican
    candidates (especially Donald Trump). Two further studies show that,
    in this climate, Latinos and Muslims in the United States feel
    heavily dehumanized, which predicts hostile responses including
    support for violent versus non-violent collective action and
    unwillingness to assist counterterrorism efforts. Our results extend
    theorizing on dehumanization, and suggest that it may have cyclical
    and self-fulfilling consequences.

- abstract: Social science research on stigma has grown dramatically
    over the past two decades, particularly in social psychology, where
    researchers have elucidated the ways in which people construct
    cognitive categories and link those categories to stereotyped
    beliefs. In the midst of this growth, the stigma concept has been
    criticized as being too vaguely defined and individually focused. In
    response to these criticisms, we define stigma as the co-occurrence
    of its components--labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss,
    and discrimination--and further indicate that for stigmatization to
    occur, power must be exercised. The stigma concept we construct has
    implications for understanding several core issues in stigma
    research, ranging from the definition of the concept to the reasons
    stigma sometimes represents a very persistent predicament in the
    lives of persons affected by it. Finally, because there are so many
    stigmatized circumstances and because stigmatizing processes can
    affect multiple domains of people's lives, stigmatization probably
    has a dramatic bearing on the distribution of life chances in such
    areas as earnings, housing, criminal involvement, health, and life
    itself. It follows that social scientists who are interested in
    understanding the distribution of such life chances should also be
    interested in stigma.

- abstract: \"In the updated second edition of Whipping Girl, Julia
    Serano, a transsexual woman whose supremely intelligent writing
    reflects her diverse background as a lesbian transgender activist
    and professional biologist, shares her powerful experiences and
    observations -- both pre- and post-transition -- to reveal the ways
    in which fear, suspicion, and dismissiveness toward femininity shape
    our societal attitudes toward trans women, as well as gender and
    sexuality as a whole. Serano's well-honed arguments stem from her
    ability to bridge the gap between the often-disparate biological and
    social perspectives on gender. In this provocative manifesto, she
    exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is
    frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this \"feminine\" weakness
    exists only to attract and appease male desire. In addition to
    debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes
    the case that today's feminists and transgender activists must work
    to embrace and empower femininity -- in all of its wondrous
    forms.\"--provided by Amazon.com

- abstract: A bstractMany U.S. states have proposed policies that
    restrict bathroom access to an individual's birth sex. These
    policies have had widespread effects on safety for transgender and
    gender-nonconforming people, as well as on state economies. In this
    registered report, we assessed the role of disgust in support for
    policies that restrict transgender bathroom access. We found that
    sensitivity to pathogen disgust was positively associated with
    support for bathroom restrictions; sexual and injury disgust were
    unrelated. We also examined the role of disgust-driven moral
    concerns, known as purity concerns, as well as harm-related moral
    concerns in support for bathroom restrictions. While concerns about
    harm to cisgender and transgender people predicted support for
    bathroom restrictions, purity was a much stronger predictor. Also,
    purity partially mediated the link between pathogen disgust and
    support for bathroom restrictions, even after accounting for harm
    concerns. Findings and implications are discussed.
