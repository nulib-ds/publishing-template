	abstract = {This paper reviews and explains the relationship between socioeconomic status and political participation from a structural perspective; i.e., social organization influences people's range of options, producing different rates of behavior among those in varying locations in the society. There are six categories of political participation: cognitive, expressive, organizational, electoral, partisan, and governmental. In each case, the poor display the lowest and the rich the highest rate of participation. This difference reflects variations in political and psychological resources and the structure of the electoral process. As a result, political benefits also differ by social class.},

	abstract = {Based on primary and secondary sources, this paper attempts to ascertain the underlying patterns and themes of women's political participation and their levels of inclusion or exclusion from the political process. A balance sheet of gender participation in formal politics reveals that there has been marked increase in voting turnout and election campaigning among women although they still continue to be excluded from legislative bodies at national and state level and deprived from key decision making positions in government and political parties.
            Field-based research shows ‘interest in polities’ as the key determinant and one of the best predictors of women's levels of political participation. Among other factors that seem to determine the intensity of women's formal participation in politics, ‘media exposure’-proxy for awareness-emerges as important variable.
            The key areas that need to be addressed for improving political participation of women and inclusion in the political process are affirmative action, better representation in legislative bodies and political parties, particularly in the decision making bodies as well as cabinet berths in government at centre and state level in partnership with civil society.},

	abstract = {"Between 2009 and 2014, an anti homosexuality law circulating in the Ugandan parliament attracted global attention for the draconian nature of its provisions and for the involvement of US antigay evangelical Christians who were reported to have lobbied for its passage. This book makes three contributions to our understanding of these developments. First, it offers an account of the international relations that anticipated and followed the Anti Homosexuality Act. Journeying through encounters between the kingdom of Buganda and British colonialism, between the Ugandan state and its international donors, and between LGBTI activists in the global South and North, the book illuminates the frictional collaborations across geopolitical divides that produce and contest contemporary queerphobias. Second, it explores the dialectic produced by two opposed statements that mark queer postcolonial disagreements-'homosexuality is Western' and 'homophobia is Western'. Arguing that both statements are true but trivial, the book demonstrates how their opposition produces distinctive forms of temporal politics in the queer postcolony. In this register, the book explores the afterlives of colonialism and the queer futures enabled by it in Uganda, India, and Britain. Third, in shifting the scenes of encounter that it investigates from one chapter to the next, the book reveals how queerness mutates in different configurations of power to become a metonym for other categories such as nationality, religiosity, race, class, and caste. It argues that these mutations reveal the grammars forged in the originary violence of the state and social institutions in which queer difference struggles to find place"--},
