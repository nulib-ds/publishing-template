- abstract: "This paper reviews and explains the relationship between
    socioeconomic status and political participation from a structural
    perspective; i.e., social organization influences people's range of
    options, producing different rates of behavior among those in
    varying locations in the society. There are six categories of
    political participation: cognitive, expressive, organizational,
    electoral, partisan, and governmental. In each case, the poor
    display the lowest and the rich the highest rate of participation.
    This difference reflects variations in political and psychological
    resources and the structure of the electoral process. As a result,
    political benefits also differ by social class."

  title: Transgenders in Kerala-Realisation of their Identity
  type: article-journal
  volume: 3
- abstract: Based on primary and secondary sources, this paper attempts
    to ascertain the underlying patterns and themes of women's political
    participation and their levels of inclusion or exclusion from the
    political process. A balance sheet of gender participation in formal
    politics reveals that there has been marked increase in voting
    turnout and election campaigning among women although they still
    continue to be excluded from legislative bodies at national and
    state level and deprived from key decision making positions in
    government and political parties. Field-based research shows
    'interest in polities' as the key determinant and one of the best
    predictors of women's levels of political participation. Among other
    factors that seem to determine the intensity of women's formal
    participation in politics, 'media exposure'-proxy for
    awareness-emerges as important variable. The key areas that need to
    be addressed for improving political participation of women and
    inclusion in the political process are affirmative action, better
    representation in legislative bodies and political parties,
    particularly in the decision making bodies as well as cabinet berths
    in government at centre and state level in partnership with civil
    society.

- abstract: \"Between 2009 and 2014, an anti homosexuality law
    circulating in the Ugandan parliament attracted global attention for
    the draconian nature of its provisions and for the involvement of US
    antigay evangelical Christians who were reported to have lobbied for
    its passage. This book makes three contributions to our
    understanding of these developments. First, it offers an account of
    the international relations that anticipated and followed the Anti
    Homosexuality Act. Journeying through encounters between the kingdom
    of Buganda and British colonialism, between the Ugandan state and
    its international donors, and between LGBTI activists in the global
    South and North, the book illuminates the frictional collaborations
    across geopolitical divides that produce and contest contemporary
    queerphobias. Second, it explores the dialectic produced by two
    opposed statements that mark queer postcolonial
    disagreements-'homosexuality is Western' and 'homophobia is
    Western'. Arguing that both statements are true but trivial, the
    book demonstrates how their opposition produces distinctive forms of
    temporal politics in the queer postcolony. In this register, the
    book explores the afterlives of colonialism and the queer futures
    enabled by it in Uganda, India, and Britain. Third, in shifting the
    scenes of encounter that it investigates from one chapter to the
    next, the book reveals how queerness mutates in different
    configurations of power to become a metonym for other categories
    such as nationality, religiosity, race, class, and caste. It argues
    that these mutations reveal the grammars forged in the originary
    violence of the state and social institutions in which queer
    difference struggles to find place\"--

- abstract: This article attempts to conceive of a contemporary history
    of gender and sexuality in Kerala. As erotic intimacies remain a
    slippery terrain for historical explorations, the focus is on the
    paradigm shifts that distinguish its recent history in this region.
    The impact of the three political developments of recent times ---
    the feminist movement, the politicisation of sex workers, and the
    queer movement --- is also looked at. Citing instances from popular
    debates and cultural artefacts, it charts out the complex
    trajectories of \"regional\" imaginations and conceptualisations of
    gender and sexualities in contemporary India.
