- abstract: Objectives. We examined relationships between social
    determinants of health and experiences of transgender-related
    discrimination reported by transgender people in Virginia. Methods.
    In 2005 through 2006, 387 self-identified transgender people
    completed a statewide health needs assessment; 350 who completed
    eligibility questions were included in this examination of factors
    associated with experiences of discrimination in health care,
    employment, or housing. We fit multivariate logistic regression
    models using generalized estimating equations to adjust for survey
    modality (online vs paper). Results. Of participants, 41% (n = 143)
    reported experiences of transgender-related discrimination. Factors
    associated with transgender-related discrimination were geographic
    context, gender (female-to male spectrum vs male-to-female
    spectrum), low socioeconomic status, being a racial/ethnic minority,
    not having health insurance, gender transition indicators (younger
    age at first transgender awareness), health care needed but unable
    to be obtained (hormone therapy and mental health services), history
    of violence (sexual and physical), substance use health behaviors
    (tobacco and alcohol), and interpersonal factors (family support and
    community connectedness). Conclusions. Findings suggest that
    transgender Virginians experience widespread discrimination in
    health care, employment, and housing. Multilevel interventions are
    needed for transgender populations, including legal protections and
    training for health care providers.

- abstract: Background. Transgender individuals have a gender identity
    that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The
    population size of transgender individuals in the United States is
    not well-known, in part because official records, including the US
    Census, do not include data on gender identity. Population surveys
    today more often collect transgender-inclusive gender-identity data,
    and secular trends in culture and the media have created a somewhat
    more favorable environment for transgender people. Objectives. To
    estimate the current population size of transgender individuals in
    the United States and evaluate any trend over time. Search methods.
    In June and July 2016, we searched PubMed, Cumulative Index to
    Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science for
    national surveys, as well as "gray" literature, through an Internet
    search. We limited the search to 2006 through 2016. Selection
    criteria. We selected population-based surveys that used probability
    sampling and included self-reported transgender-identity data. Data
    collection and analysis. We used random-effects meta-analysis to
    pool eligible surveys and used meta-regression to address our
    hypothesis that the transgender population size estimate would
    increase over time. We used subsample and leave-one-out analysis to
    assess for bias. Main results. Our meta-regression model, based on
    12 surveys covering 2007 to 2015, explained 62.5% of model
    heterogeneity, with a significant effect for each unit increase in
    survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10; b = 0.026%; P = .002).
    Extrapolating these results to 2016 suggested a current US
    population size of 390 adults per 100 000, or almost 1 million
    adults nationally. This estimate may be more indicative for younger
    adults, who represented more than 50% of the respondents in our
    analysis. Authors' conclusions. Future national surveys are likely
    to observe higher numbers of transgender people. The large variety
    in questions used to ask about transgender identity may account for
    residual heterogeneity in our models. Public health implications.
    Under- or nonrepresentation of transgender individuals in population
    surveys is a barrier to understanding social determinants and health
    disparities faced by this population. We recommend using
    standardized questions to identify respondents with transgender and
    nonbinary gender identities, which will allow a more accurate
    population size estimate.

- abstract: "AbstractIntroduction In the United States, 1.4--1.65
    million people identify as transgender, many of whom will seek
    genital gender-affirming surgery (GAS). The number of surgeons,
    geographic proximity thereof, and exclusionary insurance policies
    has limited patient access to genital GAS.Aim To assess the
    accessibility of both feminizing and masculinizing genital GAS
    (vaginoplasty, metoidioplasty, and phalloplasty) by identifying the
    location of GAS surgeons, health insurance, or payment forms
    accepted.Methods Between February and April 2018, genital GAS
    surgeons were identified via Google search. Surgeons' offices were
    contacted by telephone or e-mail.Main Outcome Measure We queried the
    type of genital GAS performed, the health insurance or payment forms
    accepted, and the type of medical practice (academic, private, or
    group managed-care practice).Results We identified 96 surgeons
    across 64 individual medical centers offering genital GAS. The
    survey response rate was 83.3%. Only 61 of 80 (76.3%) surgeons
    across 38 of 53 (72%) locations confirmed offering genital GAS. Only
    20 (40%) U.S. states had at least one genital GAS provider. 30 of 38
    (79%) locations reported accepting any form of insurance. Only 24 of
    38 (63%) locations (14 academic; 10 private/group) accepted Medicaid
    (P = .016); 18 of 38 (47%) locations (13 academic; 5 private/group)
    accepted Medicare (P = .001).Clinical Translation Reconciliation of
    the public policies regarding insurance coverage for GAS with the
    actual practices of the providers is necessary for improving access
    to GAS for transgender individuals.Strengths & Limitations We
    purposefully used a methodology mirroring how a patient would find
    GAS surgeons, which also accounts for key limitations: only surgeons
    whose services were featured on the internet were identified. We
    could not verify the services or insurance-related information
    surgeons reported.Conclusion This study suggests that access to
    genital GAS is significantly limited by the number of providers and
    the uneven geographic distribution across the United States, in
    which only 20 of 50 U.S. states have at least one genital GAS
    surgeon."

- abstract: "Background: Transgender people face numerous barriers to
    accessing care, particularly in rural settings. Transportation,
    travel time, a lack of providers offering transgender care, and
    discrimination all contribute to these barriers. The Gender Wellness
    Center was established in New York State, USA, to fill a gap in
    rural transgender care and was subsequently awarded a Robert Wood
    Johnson Foundation grant to establish a Center of Excellence. This
    study examined the implementation of the Center of Excellence, a
    complex intervention, to assess barriers and facilitators to
    implementation over 18 months. Methods: The Consolidated Framework
    for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to develop baseline and
    follow-up surveys. These were distributed to members of the core
    implementation team at the Gender Wellness Center at the midpoint
    and conclusion of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant.
    Responses were largely open-ended and analyzed qualitatively.
    Results: Results are presented in terms of CFIR domains and
    constructs, as well as the relative outlook (positive or negative)
    of implementation. Overall, there were improvements over time, with
    more encouraging feedback and examples of success at follow-up.
    Though true, organizational culture and individual beliefs about the
    provision of transgender care challenged implementation of the
    Center of Excellence throughout the project. Conclusions: This study
    highlights the importance of organizational culture on
    implementation efforts, as well as the need for complex,
