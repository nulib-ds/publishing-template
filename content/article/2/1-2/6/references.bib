	abstract = {Objectives. We examined relationships between social determinants of health and experiences of transgender-related discrimination reported by transgender people in Virginia.
            Methods. In 2005 through 2006, 387 self-identified transgender people completed a statewide health needs assessment; 350 who completed eligibility questions were included in this examination of factors associated with experiences of discrimination in health care, employment, or housing. We fit multivariate logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations to adjust for survey modality (online vs paper).
            Results. Of participants, 41\% (n = 143) reported experiences of transgender-related discrimination. Factors associated with transgender-related discrimination were geographic context, gender (female-to male spectrum vs male-to-female spectrum), low socioeconomic status, being a racial/ethnic minority, not having health insurance, gender transition indicators (younger age at first transgender awareness), health care needed but unable to be obtained (hormone therapy and mental health services), history of violence (sexual and physical), substance use health behaviors (tobacco and alcohol), and interpersonal factors (family support and community connectedness).
            Conclusions. Findings suggest that transgender Virginians experience widespread discrimination in health care, employment, and housing. Multilevel interventions are needed for transgender populations, including legal protections and training for health care providers.},

	abstract = {Background. Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The population size of transgender individuals in the United States is not well-known, in part because official records, including the US Census, do not include data on gender identity. Population surveys today more often collect transgender-inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the media have created a somewhat more favorable environment for transgender people.
            Objectives. To estimate the current population size of transgender individuals in the United States and evaluate any trend over time.
            Search methods. In June and July 2016, we searched PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science for national surveys, as well as “gray” literature, through an Internet search. We limited the search to 2006 through 2016.
            Selection criteria. We selected population-based surveys that used probability sampling and included self-reported transgender-identity data.
            Data collection and analysis. We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool eligible surveys and used meta-regression to address our hypothesis that the transgender population size estimate would increase over time. We used subsample and leave-one-out analysis to assess for bias.
            Main results. Our meta-regression model, based on 12 surveys covering 2007 to 2015, explained 62.5\% of model heterogeneity, with a significant effect for each unit increase in survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10; b = 0.026\%; P = .002). Extrapolating these results to 2016 suggested a current US population size of 390 adults per 100 000, or almost 1 million adults nationally. This estimate may be more indicative for younger adults, who represented more than 50\% of the respondents in our analysis.
            Authors’ conclusions. Future national surveys are likely to observe higher numbers of transgender people. The large variety in questions used to ask about transgender identity may account for residual heterogeneity in our models.
            Public health implications. Under- or nonrepresentation of transgender individuals in population surveys is a barrier to understanding social determinants and health disparities faced by this population. We recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with transgender and nonbinary gender identities, which will allow a more accurate population size estimate.},

              Introduction
              In the United States, 1.4–1.65 million people identify as transgender, many of whom will seek genital gender-affirming surgery (GAS). The number of surgeons, geographic proximity thereof, and exclusionary insurance policies has limited patient access to genital GAS.
            
            
              Aim
              To assess the accessibility of both feminizing and masculinizing genital GAS (vaginoplasty, metoidioplasty, and phalloplasty) by identifying the location of GAS surgeons, health insurance, or payment forms accepted.
            
            
              Methods
              Between February and April 2018, genital GAS surgeons were identified via Google search. Surgeons’ offices were contacted by telephone or e-mail.
            
            
              Main Outcome Measure
              We queried the type of genital GAS performed, the health insurance or payment forms accepted, and the type of medical practice (academic, private, or group managed-care practice).
            
            
              Results
              We identified 96 surgeons across 64 individual medical centers offering genital GAS. The survey response rate was 83.3\%. Only 61 of 80 (76.3\%) surgeons across 38 of 53 (72\%) locations confirmed offering genital GAS. Only 20 (40\%) U.S. states had at least one genital GAS provider. 30 of 38 (79\%) locations reported accepting any form of insurance. Only 24 of 38 (63\%) locations (14 academic; 10 private/group) accepted Medicaid (P = .016); 18 of 38 (47\%) locations (13 academic; 5 private/group) accepted Medicare (P = .001).
            
            
              Clinical Translation
              Reconciliation of the public policies regarding insurance coverage for GAS with the actual practices of the providers is necessary for improving access to GAS for transgender individuals.
            
            
              Strengths \& Limitations
              We purposefully used a methodology mirroring how a patient would find GAS surgeons, which also accounts for key limitations: only surgeons whose services were featured on the internet were identified. We could not verify the services or insurance-related information surgeons reported.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study suggests that access to genital GAS is significantly limited by the number of providers and the uneven geographic distribution across the United States, in which only 20 of 50 U.S. states have at least one genital GAS surgeon.},

	abstract = {Background: Transgender people face numerous barriers to accessing care, particularly in rural settings. Transportation, travel time, a lack of providers offering transgender care, and discrimination all contribute to these barriers. The Gender Wellness Center was established in New York State, USA, to fill a gap in rural transgender care and was subsequently awarded a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant to establish a Center of Excellence. This study examined the implementation of the Center of Excellence, a complex intervention, to assess barriers and facilitators to implementation over 18 months. Methods: The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to develop baseline and follow-up surveys. These were distributed to members of the core implementation team at the Gender Wellness Center at the midpoint and conclusion of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant. Responses were largely open-ended and analyzed qualitatively. Results: Results are presented in terms of CFIR domains and constructs, as well as the relative outlook (positive or negative) of implementation. Overall, there were improvements over time, with more encouraging feedback and examples of success at follow-up. Though true, organizational culture and individual beliefs about the provision of transgender care challenged implementation of the Center of Excellence throughout the project. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of organizational culture on implementation efforts, as well as the need for complex, multifaceted interventions to overcome such challenges in order to improve care for marginalized populations.},
