abstract: |
    Though many transmasculine individuals pursue pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood in their lifetimes, research on the reproductive health needs of this population remains limited. This study aimed to explore the fertility intentions and desires of transmasculine young adults, as well as the multilevel factors that influence their pregnancy-related decisions. We conducted in-depth interviews with transmasculine young adults aged 18--29 (*N* = 21) in Boston, MA, USA between February and July of 2018. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach involving inductive and deductive coding via a codebook applied by two independent coders. While many participants reported no lifetime desire for pregnancy, a sizable minority expressed some desire to become pregnant in the future. Fertility intentions were shaped by a range of anticipated barriers, including gender dysphoria, difficulty navigating gendered stereotypes about pregnancy, inadequate information about fertility and pregnancy for transmasculine individuals, and a lack of health providers with the training and experience to offer high-quality pregnancy-related care to transmasculine patients. Multilevel interventions that address cisnormative stigma and discrimination in reproductive health care settings, improve patient-provider communication, and increase provider fluency with transmasculine health needs are necessary to facilitate access to the full spectrum of fertility-related services among transmasculine young adults.

- abstract: The paper examines first-hand accounts of differently
    gendered emotional experience of the autism spectrum drawn from
    responses to online surveys, blogs and published autobiographies.
    Analysis of these materials reveals that atypical experiences and
    expressions of gender are considered relatively common among those
    on the spectrum. More literal minded than most, many describe
    meticulous attempts to seek out and solidify gender's troubling
    manifestations in their social worlds, only to find, of course, that
    no such thing as gender exists. However, this oddly absent presence
    continues to haunt autistic emotional lives; its uncanny leavings
    and doings persist, and most (neuro)typical others remain in its
    thrall, seeming to learn gender's nebulous rules as if
    telepathically. First-hand autistic accounts highlight the draining
    and relentless emotional labour that doing gender 'typically'
    requires, and many on the spectrum respond by explicitly rejecting
    or simply neglecting its confounding demands, identifying with
    neither side of the m/f divide in attempts to give up the ghost of
    gender.

- abstract: This article contributes to the burgeoning literatures on
    the sociology of diagnosis and transgender studies by examining the
    relationship between diagnostic processes and the legitimation of
    gender identity---the medicalization of transgender people. In order
    for trans-identified people to access medical and surgical services,
    they must submit to a complex mental health diagnostic process that
    relies on criteria set by the American Psychiatric Association and
    the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH). By
    focusing on provider experiences of using the Gender Identity
    Disorder (GID) diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of
    Mental Health Disorders, Fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR)
    to meet the requirements of WPATH's Standards of Care (SOC-6), we
    show that diagnostic processes can both support and inhibit a
    transpatient's abilities to access services. Participants reveal how
    deeply held cultural views pertaining to gender, mental health, and
    patient competency are entrenched in diagnostic categories. While
    the new DSM-5 has relabeled GID as Gender Dysphoria and the SOC-7
    has somewhat lessened the requirements for accessing hormone
    treatments, our data suggest that these changes will not be enough
    to alter the underlying structure of social control and power that
    diagnostic categories have over transpeople and their providers.

- abstract: Drawing from contemporary blog data, this article examines
    an emerging project termed "neuroqueer." Neuroqueer is a
    collaboration of activists, academics, and bloggers engaging in
    online community building. Neuroqueer requires those who engage in
    it to disidentify from both oppressive dominant and counterculture
    identities that perpetuate destructive medical model discourses of
    cure. It is a queer/crip response to discussions about gender,
    sexuality, and disability as pathology that works to deconstruct
    normative identity categories. Blog members employ neuroqueer
    practices to subversively combat exclusion through rejection of
    able-hetero assimilation and counteridentification in favor of
    disidentification. Of particular interest for this special issue are
    the ways in which neuroqueer perspectives build more fluid
    conceptualizations of both gender and intersectionality through
    conscious disidentification from neurotypical norms and medical
    notions of cure on which they are often unconsciously based.

- abstract: Autistic and non-autistic adults' agreement with scientific
    knowledge about autism, how they define autism, and their
    endorsement of stigmatizing conceptions of autism has not previously
    been examined. Using an online survey, we assessed autism knowledge
    and stigma among 636 adults with varied relationships to autism,
    including autistic people and nuclear family members. Autistic
    participants exhibited more scientifically based knowledge than
    others. They were more likely to describe autism experientially or
    as a neutral difference, and more often opposed the medical model.
    Autistic participants and family members reported lower stigma.
    Greater endorsement of the importance of normalizing autistic people
    was associated with heightened stigma. Findings suggest that
    autistic adults should be considered autism experts and involved as
    partners in autism research.

- abstract: Introduction There is a growing clinical recognition that a
    significant proportion of patients with gender dysphoria have
    concurrent autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Aim The purpose of this
    review is to systematically appraise the current literature
    regarding the co-occurrence of gender dysphoria and ASD. Methods A
    systematic literature search using Medline and PubMed, PsycINFO, and
    Embase was conducted from 1966 to July 2015. Main Outcome Measures
    Fifty-eight articles were generated from the search. Nineteen of
    these publications met the inclusion criteria. Results The
    literature investigating ASD in children and adolescents with gender
    dysphoria showed a higher prevalence rate of ASD compared with the
    general population. There is a limited amount of research in adults.
    Only one study showed that adults attending services for gender
    dysphoria had increased ASD scores. Another study showed a larger
    proportion of adults with atypical gender identity and ASD.
    Conclusion Although the research is limited, especially for adults,
    there is an increasing amount of evidence that suggests a
    co-occurrence between gender dysphoria and ASD. Further research is
    vital for educational and clinical purposes.

- abstract: Autism narratives are not just stories or histories,
    describing a given reality. They are creating the language in which
    to describe the experience of autism, and hence helping to forge the
    concepts in which to think autism. This paper focuses on a series of
    autobiographies that began with Grandin's Emergence. These are often
    said to show us autism from the 'inside'. The paper proposes that
    instead they are developing ways to describe experience for which
    there is little pre-existing language. Wittgenstein has many
    well-known aphorisms about how we understand other people directly,
    without inference. They condense what he had found in Wolfgang
    Köhler's Gestalt Psychology. These phenomena of direct understanding
    what other people are doing are, Köhler wrote, 'the common property
    and practice of mankind'. They are not the common property and
    practice of people with autism. Ordinary language is rich in age-old
    ways to describe what others are thinking, feeling and so forth.
    Köhler's phenomena are the bedrock on which such language rests.
    There is no such discourse for autism, because Köhler's phenomena
    are absent. But a new discourse is being made up right now, i.e.
    ways of talking for which the autobiographies serve as working
    prototypes.

- abstract: "Individuals who experience a gender identity that is
    discordant with biological sex are increasingly presenting to
    physicians for assistance in alleviating associated psychological
    distress. In contrast to prior efforts to identify and primarily
    address underlying psychiatric contributors to gender dysphoria,
    interventions that include uncritical social affirmation, use of
    gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to suppress normally timed
    puberty, and administration of cross-sex steroid hormones to induce
    desired secondary sex characteristics are now advocated by an
    emerging cohort of transgender medicine specialists. For patients
    with persistent gender dysphoria, surgery is offered to alter the
    appearance of breasts and genital organs. Efforts to address ethical
    concerns regarding this contentious treatment paradigm are dependent
    upon reliable evidence on immediate and long-term risks and
    benefits. Although strong recommendations have been made for
    invasive and potentially irreversible interventions, high-quality
    scientific data on the effects of this approach are generally
    lacking. Limitations of the existing transgender literature include
    general lack of randomized prospective trial design, small sample
    size, recruitment bias, short study duration, high subject dropout
    rates, and reliance on ?expert? opinion. Existing data reveal
    significant intervention-associated morbidity and raise serious
    concern that the primary goal of suicide prevention is not achieved.
    In addition to substantial moral questions, adherence to established
    principles of evidence-based medicine necessitates a high degree of
    caution in accepting gender-affirming medical interventions as a
    preferred treatment approach. Continued consideration and rigorous
    investigation of alternate approaches to alleviating suffering in
    people with gender dysphoria are warranted.Summary:This paper
    provides an overview of what is currently known about people who
    experience a gender identity that differs from their biological sex
    and the associated desire to engage the medical profession in
    alleviating associated discomfort and distress. The scientific
    evidence used to support current recommendations for affirming one?s
    preferred gender, halting normally timed puberty, administering
    cross-sex hormones, and surgically altering primary and secondary
    sexual traits are summarized and critically evaluated. Serious
    deficits in understanding the cause of this condition, the reasons
    for the marked increase in people presenting for medical care,
    together with immediate and long-term risks relative to benefit of
    medical intervention are exposed."

    autistic people raises provocative questions for feminist scholars.
    In particular, autistic writers often invite alternative
    understandings of sex/gender as a multiple, rhetorical phenomenon.
    Autobiographies, blogs, and Internet posts show how autistic
    individuals view gender as a copia, or tool for inventing multiple
    possibilities through available sex/gender discourses. Four
    particular discourses emerge through which autistic people
    understand gender: identification, neurodiversity, performance, and

- abstract: The rhetorical figure of the incrementum, or scale, can help
    to account for how autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been
    gendered as male, especially in Simon Baron-Cohen's \"Extreme Male
    Brain\" theory. The incrementum occurs when female, male, and
    autistic brains are placed along a scale according to systemizing
    and empathizing abilities. This double hierarchy reinforces popular
    beliefs about sex and gender, drawing on the cultural resources of
    hi-tech culture, the service economy, and geekiness. In so doing,
    these theories overlook other important aspects of ASD, including
    alternative theories, the presence of autistic women and girls, and
    the needs and interests of autistic people themselves.

- abstract: Transgender (trans) people experience high rates of mental
    health issues including depression and suicidality. Improving access
    to transition-related medicine such as hormones and surgeries is
    suggested as an important mechanism to address these mental health
    issues. Yet clinicians experience challenges assessing and referring
    trans people for transition-related medicine. Standardized
    assessment protocols have been therefore recommended to optimize
    care. Although standardized protocols are purported to expand access
    to hormones and surgeries for trans people, it is unclear whether
    these tools achieve this goal. We therefore conducted an
    institutional ethnography to explicate how standardized readiness
    assessments coordinate access to hormones and surgeries in Canada.
    We analyzed key texts, talked with trans people, clinicians,
    clinician-educators, and administrators (total n = 22), and observed
    clinician-education workshops. In the context of determining
    transition readiness, standardized protocols direct clinicians to
    explore alternative diagnoses and assess the degree to which any
    complex mental health condition is "managed" prior to initiating
    hormones or surgeries. In response, we found that trans patients
    downplay or withhold mental health concerns from clinicians, or
    otherwise do additional work (e.g., take up unwanted psychiatric
    interventions) to convince providers they are "mentally ready" to
    transition. This phenomenon is paradoxical in that
    transition-related medicine is recommended to mitigate trans
    people's psychosocial distress, but when patients reveal symptoms of
    distress they encounter significant barriers to treatment. We
    conclude that the logic underpinning pre-transition "mental
    readiness" assessments discredits the claim that standardized
    protocols optimize access to hormones and surgeries.

- abstract: Obtaining deep-level insights into the thoughts, actions,
    and emotions of organizational leaders can pose significant
    challenges to organizational scholars. Fortunately, a promising but
    largely untapped resource to provide such insights
    exists---autobiographies. We begin by providing an overview of
    autobiographies as a data source, including their benefits and
    limitations. We then discuss where autobiographies could contribute
    to theory development in organizational research, highlighting the
    areas of strategic leadership and entrepreneurship, identity, and
    sensemaking. To provide direction on how to incorporate these texts
    into a research design, we provide several research ideas and
    guidelines about how autobiographies could be used in a triangulated
    research design. We illustrate their use in a recent study conducted
    among craft entrepreneurs to confirm existing findings and document
    a series of planned studies using autobiographies to explore new
    findings. Together, the study, although focusing on autobiographies,
    offers a broader framework to advance the use of narrative forms in
    organizational scholarship.

- abstract: "More than 35 years ago I developed the basic procedures of
    a qualitative content analysis which are still widely used in
    qualitative oriented social science text analysis. I want to give an
    overview of the reception and recent developments of this
    approach.Three topics are elaborated in this article: First the
    theoretical background of qualitative content analysis is summarized
    and compared to other approaches of social science text analysis.
    This includes a differentiation of quantitative content analysis. In
    quantitative content analysis the process of categorization is
    running automatically, following a fixed algorithm, whereas in
    qualitative content analysis the assignment of categories to text
    passages always remains an act of interpretation. But this process
    strictly follows rules of interpretation. Second, the reception of
    my conception of qualitative content analysis is retraced and some
    misunderstandings cleared up. Additionally, the approach of
    qualitative content analysis proposed by Margrit SCHREIER and Udo
    KUCKARTZ is compared to my concept. This is demonstrated with an
    example. Third, recent developments are reviewed and free available
    software especially developed for qualitative content analysis
    (QCAmap) is introduced."

- abstract: In recent decades there has been much debate over the
    ontological status of autism and other neurological 'disorders',
    diagnosed by behavioural indicators, and theorised primarily within
    the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychological paradigms.
    Such cognitive-behavioural discourses abstain from acknowledging the
    universal issue of relationality and interaction in the formation of
    a contested and constantly reconstructed social reality, produced
    through the agency of its 'actors'. The nature of these contested
    interactions will be explored in this current issues piece through
    the use of the term the 'double empathy problem', and how such a
    rendition produces a critique of autism being defined as a deficit
    in 'theory of mind', re-framing such issues as a question of
    reciprocity and mutuality. In keeping with other autistic
    self-advocates, this piece will refer to 'autistic people', and
    'those who identify as on the autism spectrum', rather than 'people
    with autism'.

- abstract: "The desire for transgender futures has grown exponentially
    in recent years, but many of these futures are traps, concealing a
    demand to assume normative and neoliberal priorities in exchange for
    citizenship and belonging. This article argues that some of these
    traps might be undone through autistic disruption. Dwelling with the
    life writing and memoir of individuals both autistic and trans, it
    suggests that, by choice or by circumstance, autistic-trans
    narratives defy the chrononormative mandate of the able-minded
    future. By claiming autism and gender nonconformity as mutually
    inclusive, foregrounding alternative sensorealities, and
    interrupting the incitement to get better, this article argues that
    cripping trans time through autistic disruption offers what Gossett,
    Stanley, and Burton call a \"trap door\": a route of escape from the
    normate trans future and a way for autistic life to insist on its
    own continuation and survivance."

- abstract: "Purpose: There is evolving evidence that children and
    adolescents with gender dysphoria have higher-than-expected rates of
    autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet clinical data on ASD among youth
    with gender dysphoria remain limited, particularly in North America.
    This report aims to fill this gap.Methods: We conducted a
    retrospective review of patient chart data from 39 consecutive youth
    ages 8 to 20 years (mean age 15.8 years, natal male: n = 22, natal
    female: n = 17) presenting for evaluation at a multidisciplinary
    gender clinic in a large U.S. pediatric hospital from 2007 to 2011
    to evaluate the prevalence of ASD in this patient
    population.Results: Overall, 23.1% of patients (9/39) presenting
    with gender dysphoria had possible, likely, or very likely Asperger
    syndrome as measured by the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale
    (ASDS).Conclusion: These findings are consistent with growing
    evidence supporting increased prevalence of ASD in gender dysphoric
    children. To guide provision of optimal clinical care and
    therapeutic intervention, routine assessment of ASD is recommended
    in youth presenting for gender dysphoria."

- abstract: "Evidence indicates an overrepresentation of youth with
    co-occurring autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and gender dysphoria
    (GD). The clinical assessment and treatment of adolescents with this
    co-occurrence is often complex, related to the developmental aspects
    of ASD. There are no guidelines for clinical care when ASD and GD
    co-occur; however, there are clinicians and researchers experienced
    in this co-occurrence. This study develops initial clinical
    consensus guidelines for the assessment and care of adolescents with
    co-occurring ASD and GD, from the best clinical practices of current
    experts in the field. Expert participants were identified through a
    comprehensive international search process and invited to
    participate in a two-stage Delphi procedure to form clinical
    consensus statements. The Delphi Method is a well-studied research
    methodology for obtaining consensus among experts to define
    appropriate clinical care. Of 30 potential experts identified, 22
    met criteria as expert in co-occurring ASD and GD youth and
    participated. Textual data divided into the following data nodes:
    guidelines for assessment; guidelines for treatment; six primary
    clinical/psychosocial challenges: social functioning, medical
    treatments and medical safety, risk of victimization/safety, school,
    and transition to adulthood issues (i.e., employment and romantic
    relationships). With a cutoff of 75% consensus for inclusion,
    identified experts produced a set of initial guidelines for clinical
    care. Primary themes include the importance of assessment for GD in
    ASD, and vice versa, as well as an extended diagnostic period, often
    with overlap/blurring of treatment and assessment."

- abstract: "Despite research exploring autism in gender-diverse
    adolescents, no studies have elicited these individuals'
    perspectives. In-depth interviews with 22 well-characterized
    autistic gender-diverse adolescents revealed critical themes,
    including: recollections of pre-pubertal gender nonconformity; vivid
    experiences of gender dysphoria; a fear of social gender expression
    due to perceived animosity toward transgender people; and specific
    challenges that result from the interplay of gender diversity and
    neurodiversity. During the \\~ 22 month study social gender
    affirmation increased in six participants and gender dysphoria
    attenuated in four participants. Given the ethical imperative to
    understand and prioritize the voiced perspectives and needs of
    autistic gender minority adolescents as well as the discovery of
    shared themes and experiences in this population, results should
    inform clinical research approaches and priorities."

- abstract: Philosophical arguments regarding academic freedom can
    sometimes appear removed from the real conflicts playing out in
    contemporary universities. This paper focusses on a set of issues at
    the front line of these conflicts, namely, questions regarding sex,
    gender and gender identity. We document the ways in which the work
    of academics has been affected by political activism around these
    questions and, drawing on our respective disciplinary expertise as a
    sociologist and a philosopher, elucidate the costs of curtailing
    discussion on fundamental demographic and conceptual categories. We
    discuss some philosophical work that addresses the conceptual
    distinction between academic freedom and free speech and explore how
    these notions are intertwined in significant ways in universities.
    Our discussion elucidates and emphasises the educational costs of
    curtailing academic freedom.

- abstract: Studies have shown an increase of symptoms of autism
    spectrum disorder (ASD) in gender dysphoria (GD). Various hypotheses
    try to explain this possible co-occurrence (e.g., a role of
    resistance to change, stereotyped behaviors or prenatal testosterone
    exposure). This study examined ASD symptoms with the Children's
    Social Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ) in 490 children with GD
    compared to 2507 typically developing (TD) and 196 children with
    ASD. CSBQ total scores of the GD sample were in between scores from
    the TD and ASD sample. The GD sample showed elevated levels of
    autistic symptomatology on all subdomains, not only on stereotyped
    and resistance to change. Further, no gender differences and
    interaction effects were found on the total CSBQ, making a sole role
    for prenatal testosterone unlikely.

- abstract: "The current literature shows growing evidence of a link
    between gender dysphoria (GD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
    This study reviews the available clinical and empirical data. A
    systematic search of the literature was conducted using the
    following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus;
    utilizing different combinations of the following search terms:
    autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger's disorder (AD),
    co-morbidity, gender dysphoria (GD), gender identity disorder (GID),
    transgenderism and transsexualism. In total, 25 articles and reports
    were selected and discussed. Information was grouped by found
    co-occurrence rates, underlying hypotheses and implications for
    diagnosis and treatment. GD and ASD were found to co-occur
    frequently -- sometimes characterized by atypical presentation of
    GD, which makes a correct diagnosis and determination of treatment
    options for GD difficult. Despite these challenges there are several
    case reports describing gender affirming treatment of co-occurring
    GD in adolescents and adults with ASD. Various underlying hypotheses
    for the link between GD and ASD were suggested, but almost all of
    them lack evidence."

- abstract: Prior research has shown an elevation in autism traits and
    diagnoses in individuals seen for gender related consultation and in
    participants self-identifying as transgender. To investigate this
    relationship between autism and gender identity from a new angle, we
    compared the self-reported autism traits and sensory differences
    between participants with autism who did or did not identify with
    their assigned sex (i.e. cisgender or trans and non-binary,
    respectively). We found broad elevation of most cognitive autism
    traits in the trans and non-binary group (those who identified with
    a gender other than their assigned gender), and lower visual and
    auditory hypersensitivity. We contrast these data to existing
    hypotheses and propose a role for autistic resistance to social
    conditioning.

- abstract: We assessed whether recent psychological literature on
    children reflects or contrasts with the zeitgeist of American
    Psychological Association's recent non-discrimination statement on
    'transgender' and 'gender variant' individuals. Article records (N =
    94) on childhood 'gender identity' and 'expression' published
    between 1999 and 2008 inclusive were evaluated for two kinds of
    cisgenderism, the ideology that invalidates or pathologises
    self-designated genders that contrast with external designations.
    Misgendering language contradicts children's own gender assignations
    and was less frequent than pathologising language which constructs
    children's own gender assignations and expression as disordered.
    Articles on children's gender identity/expression are increasingly
    impactful within psychology. Cisgenderism is neither increasing nor
    decreasing overall. Mental health professionals are more
    cisgenderist than other authors. Articles by members of an
    'invisible college' structured around the most prolific author in
    this area are more cisgenderist and impactful than other articles.
    We suggest how authors and editors can implement American
    Psychological Association policy and change scientific discourse
    about children's genders.

- abstract: The question of judicial protection of trans people has come
    to the fore in recent years, culminating in Bill C-16 which added
    gender identity and gender expression to the federal
    anti-discrimination and hate crime laws. In this article, the author
    contests the notion that anti-discrimination and hate crime laws are
    effective in mitigating anti-trans harassment, discrimination, and
    violence. Suggesting that the model of anti-trans acts which
    underlies anti-discrimination and hate crime laws is erroneous, the
    author argues that the law's impact on trans well-being will be
    modest and that a careful analysis of anti-trans attitudes enables
    us to identify a number of more effective governmental avenues
    toward trans emancipation.

- abstract: Youth explore their genders -- both theirs and those of
    others. Exploration is not only a vessel of discovery and
    understanding but also of creation. Centring the notion of gender
    exploration, this article inquires into the ethical issues
    surrounding care for transgender youth. Arguing that exploration is
    best seen not as a precondition to transition-related care but as a
    process that can operate through transitioning, the article
    concludes that the gender-affirmative approach to trans youth care
    best fosters youth's capacity for healthy exploration. Unbounded
    social transition and ready access to puberty blockers ought to be
    treated as the default option, and support should be offered to
    parents who may have difficulty accepting their youth.

- abstract: The term 'rapid-onset gender dysphoria' (ROGD) was coined in
    2016 to describe an alleged epidemic of youth coming out as trans
    'out of the blue' due to social contagion and mental illness. The
    term reflects a deliberate attempt to weaponise scientific-sounding
    language to dismiss mounting empirical evidence of the benefits of
    transition. This article offers an introduction to the theory of
    ROGD and its history, presents a detailed critique of the empirical
    and theoretical claims associated with the theory, and highlights
    structural concerns with the ROGD discourse. The article argues that
    claims associated with ROGD, including assertions of declining
    mental health and degrading familial relationships following coming
    out, are best explained by the leading ROGD study's recruitment of
    parents from transantagonistic websites against a background of
    growing visibility and social acceptance of trans people. ROGD
    theory is best understood as an attempt to circumvent existing
    research demonstrating the importance of gender affirmation, relying
    on scientific-sounding language to achieve respectability.

- abstract: Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely
    acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within
    psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and
    theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We
    outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other
    qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and
    in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions.
    We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic
    analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and
    consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis.
    Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic
    analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful
    and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond
    psychology.

- abstract: Gender Identity Disorder of Childhood (GIDC)---a psychiatric
    diagnosis given to gendervariant children---has been controversial
    since its creation. Critics inside and outside of the mental health
    professions have called for the removal or revision of GIDC, arguing
    that it has served to pathologize homosexuality, to enforce
    normative notions of masculinity and femininity, and to recast a
    social problem as individual pathology. Drawing on published
    clinical and research papers, archival materials, and interviews
    with clinicians, researchers, and advocates, this article analyzes
    early studies of gendervariant boys from the 1960s and 1970s and
    describes the process through which the GIDC diagnosis was created.
    The article examines some of the limitations of current debates over
    GIDC and points out new trends that hold the most promise for
    providing support to gender-variant children.

- abstract: "Background: Transgender and non-binary children and young
    people and their parents in England, UK are poorly served across a
    range of healthcare settings. Whilst UK equalities legislation and
    international guidance on transgender healthcare pathways protects
    this group from discrimination and mandates an affirmative approach,
    services in England are not keeping pace.Aims: This study aims to
    draw on the experiences of transgender and non-binary children,
    young people and their parents in a support group in England in
    order to investigate their experiences of healthcare provision, and
    to develop some ideas for improvement.Method: Data was collected
    with participants in a family support group which offers a parent
    helpline service, social groups for children and parents, and
    training for schools and other organizations. 65 parents and
    children from 27 families from the family support group attended
    participatory workshops where they were given a range of briefs:
    \"health,\" \"family,\" \"friends,\" and \"education.\" Their participation
    involved being asked to define their own interview questions and
    collect data by interviewing each other. Their interview notes
    constituted the raw data. Data was coded inductively by the author
    with respondent checking as a second stage.Results: Results
    constitute the views of a small group of people, so cannot be
    generalized. However, they do illustrate some of the issues which
    may arise. Participants' experiences elicited five key themes:
    professionals' perceived lack of clinical and therapeutic knowledge;
    mental distress caused by excessive waiting lists; professionals'
    stereotyped gender assumptions; direct discrimination within
    healthcare settings; and a lack of attention to parent and child
    voice, especially in terms of school-based experiences and where a
    patient had a diagnosis of autism."

- abstract: Background Trans and non-binary children and young people in
    England, UK struggle to gain access to affirming clinical care,
    despite the international research evidence pointing toward this
    best practice approach. Concurrently, they are subject to constant
    discussion in the UK national media and politics, where many
    negative assumptions are made about their needs, experiences and
    clinical provision. Their journey to seek appropriate care has not
    yet been documented.Aims We trace the experiences of trans and
    non-binary children and youth and their families in their decision
    to seek, searches for and experiences with affirmative and
    non-affirmative clinical input for help with their gender.Method 27
    dyadic, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with trans and
    non-binary children and young people and their parents from 13
    families.Results The process of seeking support via National Health
    Service clinical routes in England, UK is beset with lengthy waiting
    lists, issues with geographical inaccessibility, a lack of relevant
    clinical knowledge, and a failure to recognize the value of family
    expertise. Family doctors provide contraceptive hormones in lieu of
    proper access to puberty blocking or gender affirming hormones, and
    most families resort to private care they can ill afford.Discussion
    Training in gender identity and gender dysphoria is recommended for
    both family doctors, and children's mental health services. Gender
    identity development services could be decentralized, with local
    hubs offering more accessible support.

    Manual of Mental Disorders, the American Psychiatric Association has
    changed the diagnosis of gender identity disorder to gender
    dysphoria (GD). In this critical narrative review we ask: What is
    gender dysphoria? We report on some of the inconsistencies in the
    articles that foreground distress while obfuscating the fact that
    not all trans and intersex people suffer stress or impaired
    functioning, and the inappropriate referencing to intersex people in
    the diagnostic criterion, claims about the GD diagnosis contributing
    to the depathologization of and reducing stigma surrounding trans
    people, the conceptualizations of \"gender dysphoric\" research
    subjects, and finally we question the etiological approaches using
    GD as a conceptual framework. We further suggest that there are a
    number of methodological issues that need to be resolved to be able
    to claim that the GD diagnosis can be validated. To shed light on
    these paradoxes and methodological issues in the DSM-5, we report on
    the content validity of GD by reviewing research articles
    postdiagnostic inception. These findings will contribute to the
    debate about the validity of GD as a diagnosis for the 21st century
    for those people who need to live a different gender to that
    assigned at birth."

- abstract: Although increasing numbers of children have socially
    transitioned to live in line with their gender identities, little is
    known about factors associated with their wellbeing. This study
    examines the associations between parent-reported family, peer, and
    school support for a youth's gender identity, as well as an
    objective measure of state-level support, with parent-reported
    internalizing symptoms in 265 transgender youth (67.2% transgender
    girls, 32.8% transgender boys), ages 3--15 years (M = 9.41,
    SD = 2.62). Parents who reported higher levels of family, peer, and
    school support for their child's gender identity also reported fewer
    internalizing symptoms; the objective measure of state-level support
    was not related to internalizing symptoms. Additionally, peer and
    school support buffered against the association between
    gender-related victimization and internalizing symptoms, as reported
    by parents. This work demonstrates that even among transgender youth
    with families who supported their transitions, parents see better
    well-being in their children when they also see more support for the
    child's gender identity from family, peers, and schools.

- abstract: True gender self child therapy is based on the premise of
    gender as a web that weaves together nature, nurture, and culture
    and allows for a myriad of healthy gender outcomes. This article
    presents concepts of true gender self, false gender self, and gender
    creativity as they operationalize in clinical work with children who
    need therapeutic supports to establish an authentic gender self
    while developing strategies for negotiating an environment resistant
    to that self. Categories of gender nonconforming children are
    outlined and excerpts of a treatment of a young transgender child
    are presented to illustrate true gender self child therapy.

- abstract: "The treatment of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD)
    prepubertal children has expanded both in scope and in the number of
    families seeking services over the past decade. This chapter reviews
    the extant standards of care and clinical guidelines for these
    children, synthesizing the WPATH, American Psychological
    Association, and Australian Standards of Care, while illustrating
    the ascendant approach for supporting these children: the gender
    affirmative model. The model is contrasted to earlier developed
    models of care, the \"living in your own skin\" model and the
    \"watchful waiting\" model. To illustrate the clinical approach of the
    gender affirmative model in contrast to the other two models, a
    hypothetical case of a young gender-exploring child is presented,
    with an analysis of how each of the three models might approach the
    child and family seeking care."

- abstract: An increasing number of transgender children---those who
    express a gender identity that is "opposite" their natal sex---are
    socially transitioning, or presenting as their gender identity in
    everyday life. This study asks whether these children differ from
    gender-typical peers on basic gender development tasks. Three- to
    5-year-old socially transitioned transgender children (n = 36) did
    not differ from controls matched on age and expressed gender (n =
    36), or siblings of transgender and gender nonconforming children (n
    = 24) on gender preference, behavior, and belief measures. However,
    transgender children were less likely than both control groups to
    believe that their gender at birth matches their current gender,
    whereas both transgender children and siblings were less likely than
    controls to believe that other people's gender is stable.

- abstract: "Background: Pediatric gender clinics have a long history of
    analyzing and scrutinizing parents of trans children. At present,
    gender services in countries like the UK continue to hold clinical
    sessions with parents of pre-adolescent transgender children,
    sometimes extending over many years. Clinician viewpoints dominate
    the limited existing literature, with little analysis of the
    perspectives of parents of trans children.Aims: The study aimed to
    understand the experiences that parents of socially transitioned
    pre-adolescent trans children have had in UK gender clinics.Methods:
    Data were drawn from semi-structured qualitative interviews with 30
    UK-based parents of socially transitioned trans children -- children
    who socially transitioned, for example, changed pronoun, under the
    age of eleven. This article analyzed a subset of a wider dataset,
    focusing on data from 23 parents relating to parental engagement
    with UK NHS gender clinics before their child reached
    adolescence.Results: Themes emerging from the dataset included
    parents feeling under a microscope, and parents finding gender
    clinic sessions judgemental, intrusive and inappropriate.
    Interviewees reported clinician discouragement of listening to and
    validating their children, as well as a lack of emotional
    support.Discussion: The article presents evidence of continued
    pathologisation and problematisation of childhood gender diversity
    in parental engagements with UK children's gender clinics. It
    concludes by contrasting current UK practice as described in
    parental accounts with gender affirmative approaches to supporting
    parents of trans children."

    increased risk for adverse mental health outcomes, but better family
    functioning may be protective. This study describes TGN youth's
    mental health and associations with family functioning in a
    community-based sample. Participants were from 33 families (96
    family members) and included 33 TGN youth, ages 13 to 17 years; 48
    cisgender (non-transgender) caregivers; and 15 cisgender siblings.
    Participants completed a survey with measures of family functioning
    (family communication, family satisfaction) and mental health of TGN
    youth (suicidality, self-harm, depression, anxiety, self-esteem,
    resilience). TGN youth reported a high risk of mental health
    concerns: suicidality (15% to 30%), self-harm (49%), clinically
    significant depressive symptoms (61%); and moderate self-esteem (M =
    27.55, SD = 7.15) and resiliency (M = 3.67, SD = 0.53). In adjusted
    models, better family functioning from the TGN youth's perspective
    was associated with better mental health outcomes among TGN youth (β
    ranged from −0.40 to −0.65 for self-harm, depressive symptoms, and
    anxious symptoms, and 0.58 to 0.70 for self-esteem and resiliency).
    Findings from this study highlight the importance of considering TGN
    youth's perspectives on the family to inform interventions to
    improve family functioning in families with TGN youth."

- abstract: "Purpose: We examined associations between family rejection
    and risk of suicide attempts and substance misuse among a national
    sample of transgender and gender nonconforming adults.Methods: Data
    were drawn from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey
    (N = 6456). This secondary analysis was restricted to 3458
    individuals who self-identified as transgender or gender
    nonconforming and provided complete data on study variables. We used
    multivariable logistic regression to examine health risks by level
    of reported family rejection (low/moderate/high), controlling for
    relevant sociodemographic characteristics.Results: Overall, 42.3% of
    the sample reported a suicide attempt and 26.3% reported misusing
    drugs or alcohol to cope with transgender-related discrimination.
    After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex assigned at birth,
    binary gender identity, income, education, and employment status,
    family rejection was associated with increased odds of both
    behaviors. Odds increased significantly with increasing levels of
    family rejection.Conclusions: Family rejection related to gender
    identity is an understudied interpersonal stressor that may
    negatively affect health outcomes for transgender and gender
    nonconforming individuals. A better understanding of the role of
    close relationships in both risk and resilience for transgender
    individuals is critical in the development of effective public
    health interventions for this community."

- abstract: The present study represents findings from interviews with
    five mothers, each of whom had a transgender child. All of the
    transgender children were natal/biological males between the ages of
    8 and 11 years old and had socially transitioned to living as girls.
    Ehrensaft's (2012) notion of the "true gender self" was integrated
    with an ecological perspective to examine multiple interacting
    contexts, including family, neighborhood, and school, in which the
    participants lived. An overarching theme of "transformation" (or
    lack thereof) was used to organize the findings in relation to the
    transgender children, their families, and their communities. Changes
    in relation to the children's demeanor and well-being before and
    after their social transitions (e.g., from shy and depressed to
    happy and well-adjusted), the parents' and other family members'
    feelings and reactions to the children's gender identities and
    expressions over time (e.g., health care professionals and school
    staff learning along with and from the families), and the responses
    of others in the community (e.g., lack of knowledgeable health care
    professionals and school personnel) are discussed. Findings have
    implications for practice and future research.

- abstract: "Research Findings: Under the United Nations Convention on
    the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), children have the right to express
    their views on all matters affecting them and to have those views
    given due weight. This right applies in the context of research;
    however, examples of young children being engaged as co-researchers
    remain rare. Practice or Policy: This article examines the
    implications of adopting an explicit UNCRC-informed approach to
    engaging children as co-researchers. It draws on a research project
    that sought to ascertain young children's views on after-school
    programs and that involved a university-based research team working
    along with 2 groups of co-researchers; each composed of 4 children
    aged 4 to 5. The article discusses the contribution made by children
    to the development of the research questions and choice of methods
    and their involvement in the interpretation of the data and
    dissemination of the findings. It suggests that, although there are
    limits to what young children can and will want to do in the context
    of adult-led research studies, an explicit UNCRC-informed approach
    requires the adoption of supportive strategies that can assist
    children to engage in a meaningful way, with consequent benefits for
    the research findings and outputs."

- abstract: Purpose  Standards for reporting exist for many types of
    quantitative research, but currently none exist for the broad
    spectrum of qualitative research. The purpose of the present study
    was to formulate and define standards for reporting qualitative
    research while preserving the requisite flexibility to accommodate
    various paradigms, approaches, and methods. Method  The authors
    identified guidelines, reporting standards, and critical appraisal
    criteria for qualitative research by searching PubMed, Web of
    Science, and Google through July 2013; reviewing the reference lists
    of retrieved sources; and contacting experts. Specifically, two
    authors reviewed a sample of sources to generate an initial set of
    items that were potentially important in reporting qualitative
    research. Through an iterative process of reviewing sources,
    modifying the set of items, and coding all sources for items, the
    authors prepared a near-final list of items and descriptions and
    sent this list to five external reviewers for feedback. The final
    items and descriptions included in the reporting standards reflect
    this feedback. Results  The Standards for Reporting Qualitative
    Research (SRQR) consists of 21 items. The authors define and explain
    key elements of each item and provide examples from recently
    published articles to illustrate ways in which the standards can be
    met. Conclusions  The SRQR aims to improve the transparency of all
    aspects of qualitative research by providing clear standards for
    reporting qualitative research. These standards will assist authors
    during manuscript preparation, editors and reviewers in evaluating a
    manuscript for potential publication, and readers when critically
    appraising, applying, and synthesizing study findings.

- abstract: Internationally and within New Zealand there has been a
    substantial increase in the demand for gender affirming healthcare
    over the past decade. The Youth'12 secondary school survey,
    estimated that approximately 1.2% of adolescents in New Zealand
    identify as transgender.¹ It is likely that this level of referrals
    to health services will continue in the foreseeable future. This
    guideline has been developed following the recognition that New
    Zealand's previous good practice guide, Gender Reassignment Health
    Services for Trans People within New Zealand,² which was based
    heavily on the World Professional Association of Transgender Health,
    Standards of Care, version 6 (WPATH SOC v6),³ requires updating to
    be in step with current practice and international guidelines.
    Transgender healthcare is a rapidly evolving area of medicine. WPATH
    is the international body responsible for producing standards of
    care. WPATH SOC v7,⁴ was published soon after New Zealand's good
    practice guide and version 8 is currently in development. This
    guideline is not intended to replace the WPATH SOC but to present
    additional guidance for the provision of gender affirming healthcare
    in Aotearoa, New Zealand. We hope that this guide will be used to
    support the development of health services providing gender
    affirming healthcare around the country and provide guidance to
    District Health Boards (DHBs). We use Sir Mason Durie's health
    framework to inform the kaupapa or approach of these guidelines.
    WPATH SOC v7 encourages culturally appropriate approaches which are
    contextually based.⁴ Durie's model for health promotion development,
    Te Pae Māhutonga (the Southern Cross), has two guiding principles
    which correspond to the pointer stars of the constellation, Te Mana
    Whakahaere and Ngā Manukura.⁵

- abstract: Transgender children who have socially transitioned, that
    is, who identify as the gender "opposite" their natal sex and are
    supported to live openly as that gender, are increasingly visible in
    society, yet we know nothing about their mental health. Previous
    work with children with gender identity disorder (GID; now termed
    gender dysphoria) has found remarkably high rates of anxiety and
    depression in these children. Here we examine, for the first time,
    mental health in a sample of socially transitioned transgender
    children.A community-based national sample of transgender,
    prepubescent children (n = 73, aged 3--12 years), along with control
    groups of nontransgender children in the same age range (n = 73 age-
    and gender-matched community controls; n = 49 sibling of transgender
    participants), were recruited as part of the TransYouth Project.
    Parents completed anxiety and depression measures.Transgender
    children showed no elevations in depression and slightly elevated
    anxiety relative to population averages. They did not differ from
    the control groups on depression symptoms and had only marginally
    higher anxiety symptoms.Socially transitioned transgender children
    who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally
    normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in
    anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within
    this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of
    children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have
    notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously
    reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.

- abstract: "A visible and growing cohort of transgender children in
    North America live according to their expressed gender rather than
    their natal sex, yet scientific research has largely ignored this
    population. In the current study, we adopted methodological advances
    from social-cognition research to investigate whether 5- to
    12-year-old prepubescent transgender children (N = 32), who were
    presenting themselves according to their gender identity in everyday
    life, showed patterns of gender cognition more consistent with their
    expressed gender or their natal sex, or instead appeared to be
    confused about their gender identity. Using implicit and explicit
    measures, we found that transgender children showed a clear pattern:
    They viewed themselves in terms of their expressed gender and showed
    preferences for their expressed gender, with response patterns
    mirroring those of two cisgender (nontransgender) control groups.
    These results provide evidence that, early in development,
    transgender youth are statistically indistinguishable from cisgender
    children of the same gender identity."

- abstract: This article proposes that survival may be considered a
    research method for social researchers, especially if they are
    undertaking fieldwork within marginalised communities of which they
    are a part. Drawing on an autoethnographic account of conducting
    research while trans, it shows how marginalised researchers may
    encounter both challenges common within the neoliberal university,
    and troubles specific to the researcher's social identity, touching
    on experiences of casualisation, distressing fieldwork, trauma, and
    suicide. The article concludes that marginalised researchers should
    not be held individually responsible for their own survival; rather,
    they require the active support of research communities and
    institutional frameworks.

- abstract: Chosen name use among transgender youth (youth whose gender
    identities are different from their sex assigned at birth) can be
    part of the complex process of aligning gender presentation with
    gender identity and can promote mental health. However, little is
    known about the factors that predict whether or not transgender
    youth have a chosen name and outcomes of chosen name use, especially
    in specific social contexts. We examined, among a sample of 129
    transgender youth from three cities in the United States,
    differences in sociodemographic characteristics and mental health
    outcomes between transgender youth with and without a chosen name
    and, among those with a chosen name, predictors and mental health
    benefits of being able to use a chosen name at home, school, and
    work. There were few differences between transgender youth with and
    without a chosen name. Among transgender youth with a chosen name,
    disclosure of gender identity to supportive family and teachers
    predicted chosen name use at home and school, respectively. Chosen
    name use was associated with large reductions in negative health
    outcomes and relatively smaller improvements in positive mental
    health outcomes. Our results show that chosen name use is part of
    the gender affirmation process for some, but not all, transgender
    youth and is associated with better mental health among transgender
    youth who adopt a chosen name.

- abstract: "Background : The literature on trans youth has been
    dominated by etiological studies interested in trans experience as a
    medical phenomenon. An emerging body of literature has begun to
    document that trans youth are a diverse, vulnerable, yet resilient
    population, and to investigate the role of various sites of support
    such as the family, peer groups, institutions, and community spaces
    in contributing to or impeding trans youth's well-being. Method:
    This article presents the results of Stage One of interviews (n =
    24) conducted for a Community-Based Participatory Action Research
    (CBPAR) qualitative research project based in Quebec. It studies the
    factors that enhance trans youth's well-being as well as the factors
    of oppression that negatively affect it. This paper offers a brief
    overview of the anti-oppressive methodology used for this project,
    emphasizing how CBPAR was combined with Grounded Theory (GT) methods
    to encourage the direct involvement of communities and the
    translation of knowledge into action. Results: We present
    preliminary categories emerging through the ongoing axial coding
    process. These categories address trans youth's experiences in and
    perceptions of various \"sites\": 1) healthcare services both for
    gender-related and general care, 2) other institutional spaces, 3)
    the family and other social circles, and 4) community spaces.
    Conclusion: While much of this study's results support existing
    evidence on trans youth's experiences, they also provide a more
    nuanced portrayal of the complex ways in which recognition, as well
    as non-, mis-, or mal-recognition, influence trans youth's
    well-being at different sites. We also argue that recognition itself
    must be considered through the lens of intersectionality."

- abstract: Trans and non-binary youth (TNBY) face high levels of
    interpersonal and social adversity as well as disproportionate rates
    of mental health issues such as depression, self-harm and suicidal
    ideation. Among protective factors, context plays a key role. In
    addition to parental support, access to gender-affirming medical
    care begins to emerge as crucial for young people needed them. This
    paper compares, through thematic analysis, the experiences of TNBY
    with regard to access and experiences to care in Canada,
    Switzerland, England, and Australia. It identifies similarities and
    differences in barriers to access to care, as well as impacts of
    gender affirming care on young people and their well-being. The
    article concludes with a discussion on the importance of prompt and
    easier access to gender-affirming medical care, of training of
    professionals, and a hypothesis about the role of context in TNBY
    well-being.

- abstract: "Background: Canadian specialty clinics offering
    gender-affirming care to trans and gender diverse children and youth
    have observed a significant increase in referrals in recent years,
    but there is a lack of information about the experiences of young
    people receiving care. Furthermore, treatment protocols governing
    access to gender-affirming medical interventions remain a topic of
    debate.Aims: This qualitative research aims to develop a deeper
    understanding of experiences of trans youth seeking and receiving
    gender-affirming care at Canadian specialty clinics, including their
    goals in accessing care, feelings about care and medical
    interventions they have undergone, and whether they have any regrets
    about these interventions.Methods: The study uses an adapted
    Grounded Theory methodology from social determinants of health
    perspective. Thirty-five trans and gender diverse young people aged
    9 to 17 years were recruited to participate in semi-structured
    interviews through the specialty clinics where they had received or
    were waiting for gender-affirming medical interventions such as
    puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery.Results: Young people
    felt positively overall about the care they had received and the
    medical interventions they had undergone, with many recounting an
    improvement in their well-being since starting care. Most commonly
    shared frustrations concerned delays in accessing interventions due
    to clinic waiting lists or treatment protocols. Some youth described
    unwanted medication side-effects and others said they had questioned
    their transition trajectory at certain moments in the past, but none
    regretted their choice to undergo the interventions.Discussion: The
    results suggest that trans youth and gender diverse children are
    benefiting from medical gender-affirming care they receive at
    specialty clinics, providing valuable insight into their
    decision-making processes in seeking care and specific
    interventions. Providers might consider adjusting aspects of
    treatment protocols (such as age restrictions, puberty stage, or
    mental health assessments) or applying them on a more flexible,
    case-by-case basis to reduce barriers to access."

- abstract: As a traditionally underserved population that faces
    numerous health disparities, youth who identify as transgender and
    gender diverse (TGD) and their families are increasingly presenting
    to pediatric providers for education, care, and referrals. The need
    for more formal training, standardized treatment, and research on
    safety and medical outcomes often leaves providers feeling ill
    equipped to support and care for patients that identify as TGD and
    families. In this policy statement, we review relevant concepts and
    challenges and provide suggestions for pediatric providers that are
    focused on promoting the health and positive development of youth
    that identify as TGD while eliminating discrimination and stigma.

- abstract: Past studies that compare cisgender to transgender (or
    trans) and gender diverse people have found a higher prevalence of
    mental health problems among the latter groups. This article uses
    Testa's gender minority stress framework, which is an expansion of
    minority stress theory, to assess minority stressors that are
    specific to the experiences of trans and gender diverse people. The
    concept of cisnormativity, an ideology that positions cisgender
    identities as a norm, is used in relation to the gender minority
    stress framework to describe the marginalizing nature of social
    environments for trans and gender diverse people. This article
    provides a critical review that integrates and expands on past
    theoretical perspectives on gender minority stressors and protective
    factors. Specifically, this article demonstrates the relevance of
    cultural and ethnic backgrounds to complement the application of
    intersectionality in research on health disparities experienced by
    trans and gender diverse people.

- abstract: Introduction International evidence has found large mental
    health inequities among transgender people and demonstrates that
    mental health outcomes are associated with enacted stigma
    experiences and protective factors. This study aimed to examine the
    extent of associations of enacted stigma experiences specific to
    transgender people alongside protective factors with mental health
    of transgender people in Aotearoa/New Zealand.Methods The 2018
    Counting Ourselves survey was a nationwide community-based study of
    transgender people (N = 1178, Mage = 29.5) living in Aotearoa/New
    Zealand. The survey assessed a wide range of gender minority stress
    experiences and protective factors that comprised primary (support
    from friends and family) and secondary social ties (neighborhood and
    transgender community belongingness). We calculated the predicted
    probabilities that transgender people exhibit very high
    psychological distress level, non-suicidal self-injury, and suicidal
    risks with different combinations and exposure profiles of enacted
    stigma and protective factors.Results Our findings demonstrated that
    enacted stigma was associated with negative mental health, and
    support of friends and family was linked to better outcomes across
    all mental health measures. Beyond primary social ties, sense of
    belongingness to neighborhood and transgender communities were
    linked to reduced odds of psychological distress and suicidal
    ideation. For those scoring high on enacted stigma and low on
    protective factors, our model revealed a 25% probability of
    attempting suicide in the last year compared to 3% for those scoring
    low on enacted stigma and high on protective factors.Conclusions
    Echoing previous findings, this study demonstrates that transgender
    people across Aotearoa/New Zealand are less likely to manifest
    life-threatening mental health outcomes if they experience low
    levels of enacted stigma and high levels of access to protective
    factors. Our findings suggest a need to address the enacted stigma
    that transgender people face across interpersonal and structural
    settings, and also to enhance social supports that are gender
    affirmative for this population.

- abstract: The Division of Clinical Psychology (DCP) of the British
    Psychological Society (BPS) invited Professor Ken Zucker as a
    keynote speaker to their annual conference in December 2010 (BPS,
    2010). Zucker works at the Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental
    Health (CAMH) and is considered an authoritative figure in the
    controversial diagnosis and 'treatment' of children with 'Gender
    Identity Disorder' (Hill et al. 2006). He is also Chair of the
    American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Sexual and Gender Identity
    Disorders Work Group for the DSM-5 (APA, 2010). His invitation was
    proposed by the DCP conference committee 'expert group' who research
    potential speakers for the division (J. Unwin, personal
    communication, November 15, 2010). This invitation sparked an angry
    and concerned response from many. Zucker's work at the CAMH GID
    clinic has been widely criticised by academics (e.g. Wilson, 2000;
    Wren, 2002; Menvielle & Tuerk, 2002; Hird, 2003; Langer & Martin,
    2004; Lev, 2005; Bryant, 2008), organisations (e.g. Burleton, 2008;
    Choe, 2008; Queerty, 2009) and individuals concerned with LGBT
    issues and gender diversity.

- abstract: Background Pediatric gender identity has gained increased
    attention over the past several years in the popular media,
    political arena, and medical literature. This article reviews
    terminology in this evolving field, traditional models of gender
    identity development and their limitations, epidemiology and natural
    history of cross-gender identification among children and
    adolescents, co-occurring conditions and behaviors, research into
    the biological and psychosocial determinants of cross-gender
    identification, and research into the options regarding and benefits
    of clinical approaches to gender incongruent youth. Methods Based on
    a critical review of the extant literature, both theoretical and
    empirical, that addresses the issue of pediatric gender identity,
    the authors synthesized what is presently known and what is in need
    of further research in order to elucidate the developmental
    trajectory and clinical needs of gender diverse youth. Results The
    field of pediatric gender identity has evolved substantially over
    the past several years. New research suggests that cross-gender
    identification is prevalent (approximately 1% of youth). These youth
    suffer disproportionately high rates of anxiety, depression, and
    suicidality. Although research into the etiology of cross-gender
    identification is limited, emerging data have shown that affirmative
    treatment protocols may improve the high rates of mental health
    difficulties seen among these patients. Conclusions The field of
    pediatric gender identity has evolved dramatically. Emerging data
    suggest that these patients' high rates of anxiety, depression, and
    suicidality appear to be improved with affirmative protocols,
    although future longitudinal data are needed.

- abstract: "Purpose: We aimed to assess the Minority Stress Model which
    proposes that the stress of experiencing stigma leads to adverse
    mental health outcomes, but social supports (e.g., school and family
    connectedness) will reduce this negative effect.Methods: We measured
    stigma-related experiences, social supports, and mental health
    (self-injury, suicide, depression, and anxiety) among a sample of
    923 Canadian transgender 14- to 25-year-old adolescents and young
    adults using a bilingual online survey. Logistic regression models
    were conducted to analyze the relationship between these risk and
    protective factors and dichotomous mental health outcomes among two
    separate age groups, 14- to 18-year-old and 19- to 25-year-old
    participants.Results: Experiences of discrimination, harassment, and
    violence (enacted stigma) were positively related to mental health
    problems and social support was negatively associated with mental
    health problems in all models among both age groups. Among 14--18
    year olds, we examined school connectedness, family connectedness,
    and perception of friends caring separately, and family
    connectedness was always the strongest protective predictor in
    multivariate models. In all the mental health outcomes we examined,
    transgender youth reporting low levels of enacted stigma experiences
    and high levels of protective factors tended to report favorable
    mental health outcomes. Conversely, the majority of participants
    reporting high levels of enacted stigma and low levels of protective
    factors reported adverse mental health outcomes.Conclusion: While
    these findings are limited by nonprobability sampling procedures and
    potential additional unmeasured risk and protective factors, the
    results provide positive evidence for the Minority Stress Model in
    this population and affirm the need for policies and programs to
    support schools and families to support transgender youth."

- abstract: The transgender population has been subject to a troubled
    history of ethically and methodologically flawed research practices.
    Whilst interest and ethical standards have both risen, there remains
    little specific methodological consideration of research with
    transgender participants. This article draws on practical
    experiences of doing research with transgender communities, and
    insider group status, to construct six categories to consider when
    working on trans-focused research. These categories include the
    importance of transgender history, the assurance of transparency,
    the significance of nuanced language use, the benefits of feminist
    methodological contributions, the value of intersectionality and the
    necessity of respecting trans spaces. The article concludes by
    reflecting on the overlapping and non-exhaustive nature of these
    categories, and wider structural concerns that may trouble knowledge
    production more generally.

- abstract: The process used to locate and recruit participants in a
    qualitative study is important for controlling bias and for
    efficiently obtaining a representative sample. In complex societies
    without clearly bounded groups from which to sample, participant
    recruitment requires especially careful consideration. Yet few
    qualitative researchers discuss their recruitment methods. This
    paper describes a site-based procedure for locating, selecting, and
    recruiting participants for qualitative research for communitybased
    research in contemporary societies. An example of this procedure
    applied in a study of nutrition and health among older adults of two
    rural counties in North Carolina is presented. Additional uses for
    this procedure are discussed.

- abstract: "Purpose: Gender-affirming surgeries and hormone therapy are
    medically necessary treatments to alleviate gender dysphoria;
    however, significant gaps exist in the research and clinical
    literature on surgery utilization and age of hormone therapy
    initiation among transgender adults.Methods: We conducted a
    retrospective review of electronic health record data from a random
    sample of 201 transgender patients of ages 18--64 years who
    presented for primary care between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2015
    (inclusive) at an urban community health center in Boston, MA. Fifty
    percent in our analyses were trans masculine (TM), 50% trans
    feminine, and 24% reported a genderqueer/nonbinary gender identity.
    Regression models were fit to assess demographic, gender
    identity-related, sexual history, and mental health correlates of
    gender-affirming surgery and of age of hormone therapy
    initiation.Results: Overall, 95% of patients were prescribed
    hormones by their primary care provider, and the mean age of
    initiation of masculinizing or feminizing hormone prescriptions was
    31.8 years (SD=11.1). Younger age of initiation of hormone
    prescriptions was associated with being TM, being a student,
    identifying as straight/heterosexual, having casual sexual partners,
    and not having past alcohol use disorder. Approximately one-third
    (32%) had a documented history of gender-affirming surgery. Factors
    associated with increased odds of surgery were older age, higher
    income levels, not identifying as bisexual, and not having a current
    psychotherapist.Conclusion: This study extends our understanding of
    prevalence and factors associated with gender-affirming treatments
    among transgender adults seeking primary care. Findings can inform
    future interventions to expand delivery of clinical care for
    transgender patients."

- abstract: Despite the burgeoning scholarship on transgender health and
    health care, the literature on transgender reproduction and
    reproductive medicine remains limited. In this narrative literature
    review, we examine recently published studies focused on the
    pregnancy and birth experiences of transgender men to provide an
    overview of the literature's major contributions and illuminate the
    gaps that exist within this research. Our review reveals that
    transgender men face substantial obstacles to achieving pregnancy
    and significant challenges during pregnancy and birth, which are
    informed by institutionalized cisnormativity embedded within medical
    norms and practices. This article demonstrates the importance of
    better understanding transgender men's reproductive health care
    needs in order to improve the quality of pregnancy-related health
    care delivery to this population. Our findings also provide insight
    for researchers, health care providers, and educators seeking to
    create and enhance gender-affirming medical education and training.

- abstract: Purpose Little is known about the reproductive desires of
    transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) adolescents who may seek
    gender-affirming medical care that leads to infertility. The current
    study addressed this gap by examining attitudes toward fertility and
    family formation in a diverse sample of TGNC youth. Method An online
    survey about sexual/reproductive health in sexual and gender
    minority (SGM) adolescents ages 14--17 years was conducted from
    September to October 2016. Results A total of 156 TGNC adolescents
    (Mage = 16.1 years; 83.3% assigned female at birth; 58.3% youth of
    color) responded. Overall, 70.5% of TGNC adolescents were interested
    in adoption and 35.9% in biological parenthood; more
    gender-nonconforming youth (43.8%) than transgender youth (25.8%)
    expressed interest in biological fertility. Discussions with
    health-care providers about fertility and reproductive health were
    uncommon---only 20.5% of youth had discussed fertility in general
    and only 13.5% had discussed effects of hormones on fertility.
    However, 60.9% of respondents were interested in learning more about
    their fertility and family building options. Key themes emerging
    from qualitative comments included concerns related to
    fertility/reproductive health (e.g., stigma of SGM parenthood,
    effect of gender-affirming treatments on fertility), and the need
    for additional reproductive health information both tailored to
    their individual experience and for SGM individuals more generally.
    Discussion TGNC adolescents expressed interest in multiple family
    building options, including adoption and biological parenthood, and
    identified a need for more information about these options. Thus,
    clinicians working with adolescents should be aware of the unique
    fertility and reproductive health needs of TGNC youth.

- abstract: "Introduction Like members of any other population,
    transgender and gender variant people - individuals whose gender
    identity varies from the traditional norm or from the sex they were
    assigned at birth - often seek parenthood. Little is known about the
    decision making and experiences of these individuals, including
    male-identified and gender-variant natal females who wish to achieve
    parenthood by carrying a pregnancy. This pilot qualitative study
    used grounded theory methodology to explore the conception,
    pregnancy, and birth experiences of this population of parents.
    Methods A grounded theory methodology was used to guide data
    collection and analysis. Eight male-identified or gender-variant
    gestational parents participated in the study. Data collection
    included individual 60-minute to 90-minute interviews conducted by
    recorded online video calls, as well as a self-administered online
    demographic survey. Data were collected from September 2011 through
    May 2012. Data saturation was achieved at 6 interviews, after which
    2 more interviews were conducted. The interviews were transcribed
    verbatim, and a constant comparative method was used to analyze the
    interview transcripts. Results Loneliness was the overarching theme
    that permeated participants' experiences, social interactions, and
    emotional responses during every stage of achieving biologic
    parenthood. Within this context of loneliness, participants
    described complex internal and external processes of navigating
    identity. Navigating identity encapsulated 2 subthemes: undergoing
    internal struggles and engaging with the external world. The
    preconception period was identified as participants' time of
    greatest distress and least involvement with health care. Discussion
    The findings of this study suggest that culturally-sensitive
    preconception counseling could be beneficial for transgender and
    gender-variant individuals. The grounded theory produced by this
    pilot investigation also provides insights that will be useful to
    health care providers and others working with male-identified and
    gender-variant prospective parents."

- abstract: In this article, the authors describe how they used a hybrid
    process of inductive and deductive thematic analysis to interpret
    raw data in a doctoral study on the role of performance feedback in
    the self-assessment of nursing practice. The methodological approach
    integrated data-driven codes with theory-driven ones based on the
    tenets of social phenomenology. The authors present a detailed
    exemplar of the staged process of data coding and identification of
    themes. This process demonstrates how analysis of the raw data from
    interview transcripts and organizational documents progressed toward
    the identification of overarching themes that captured the
    phenomenon of performance feedback as described by participants in
    the study.

- abstract: Some transgender men retain their uterus, get pregnant, and
    give birth. However, societal attitudes about gender have erected
    barriers to openly being pregnant and giving birth as a transgender
    man. Little research exists regarding transgender men's reproductive
    needs. Anecdotal observations suggest that social change and
    increasing empowerment of transgender men may result in increasing
    frequency and openness about pregnancy and birth. Specific needs
    around conception, pregnancy, and newborn care may arise from
    transphobia, exogenous testosterone exposure, or from having had (or
    desiring) gender-affirming surgery. We undertook a qualitative study
    to understand the needs of transgender men who had given birth.

- abstract: "OBJECTIVE:  To conduct a cross-sectional study of
    transgender men who had been pregnant and delivered after
    transitioning from female-to-male gender to help guide practice and
    further investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  We administered a
    web-based survey from March to December 2013 to inquire about
    demographics, hormone use, fertility, pregnancy experience, and
    birth outcomes. Participants were not required to have been on
    hormone therapy to be eligible. We used a mixed-methods approach to
    evaluate the quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS:  Forty-one
    self-described transgender men completed the survey. Before
    pregnancy, 61% (n=25) had used testosterone. Mean age at conception
    was 28 years with a standard deviation of 6.8 years. Eighty-eight
    percent of oocytes (n=36) came from participants' own ovaries. Half
    of the participants received prenatal care from a physician and 78%
    delivered in a hospital. Qualitative themes included low levels of
    health care provider awareness and knowledge about the unique needs
    of pregnant transgender men as well as a desire for resources to
    support transgender men through their pregnancy. CONCLUSION: 
    Transgender men are achieving pregnancy after having socially,
    medically, or both transitioned. Themes from this study can be used
    to develop transgender-appropriate services and interventions that
    may improve the health and health care experiences of transgender
    men."

  type: book
- abstract: "Background: Transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive
    (TGE) people experience pregnancy. Quantitative data about pregnancy
    intentions and outcomes of TGE people are needed to identify
    patterns in pregnancy intentions and outcomes and to inform
    clinicians how best to provide gender-affirming and competent
    pregnancy care. Aims: We sought to collect data on pregnancy
    intentions and outcomes among TGE people assigned female or intersex
    at birth in the United States. Methods: Collaboratively with a
    study-specific community advisory team, we designed a customizable,
    online survey to measure sexual and reproductive health experiences
    among TGE people. Eligible participants included survey respondents
    who identified as a man or within the umbrella of transgender,
    nonbinary, or gender-expansive identities; were 18 years or older;
    able to complete an electronic survey in English; lived in the
    United States; and were assigned female or intersex at birth.
    Participants were recruited through The PRIDE Study - a national,
    online, longitudinal cohort study of sexual and gender minority
    people - and externally via online social media postings, TGE
    community e-mail distribution lists, in-person TGE community events,
    and academic and community conferences. We conducted descriptive
    analyses of pregnancy-related outcomes and report frequencies
    overall and by racial and ethnic identity, pregnancy intention, or
    testosterone use. Results: Out of 1,694 eligible TGE respondents who
    provided reproductive history data, 210 (12%) had been pregnant. Of
    these, 115 (55%) had one prior pregnancy, 47 (22%) had two prior
    pregnancies, and 48 (23%) had three or more prior pregnancies. Of
    the 433 pregnancies, 169 (39%) resulted in live birth, 142 (33%)
    miscarried, 92 (21%) ended in abortion, two (0.5%) ended in
    stillbirth, two (0.5%) had an ectopic pregnancy, and seven (2%) were
    still pregnant; nineteen pregnancies (4%) had an unknown outcome.
    Among live births, 39 (23%) were delivered via cesarean section.
    Across all pregnancies, 233 (54%) were unintended. Fifteen
    pregnancies occurred after initiation of testosterone, and four
    pregnancies occurred while taking testosterone. Among all
    participants, 186 (11%) wanted a future pregnancy, and 275 (16%)
    were unsure; 182 (11%) felt \\\"at risk\\\" for an unintended pregnancy.
    Discussion: TGE people in the United States plan for pregnancy,
    experience pregnancy (intended and unintended) and all pregnancy
    outcomes, and are engaged in family building. Sexual and
    reproductive health clinicians and counselors should avoid
    assumptions about pregnancy capacity or intentions based on a
    patient's presumed or stated gender or engagement with
    gender-affirming hormone therapy."

- abstract: We aim to make evident that solely referencing cisgender
    women in the context of sexual and reproductive health-particularly
    pregnancy planning and care-excludes a diverse group of transgender
    and gender nonbinary people who have sexual and reproductive health
    needs and experiences that can be similar to but also unique from
    those of cisgender women. We call on clinicians and researchers to
    ensure that all points of sexual and reproductive health access,
    research, sources of information, and care delivery comprehensively
    include and are accessible to people of all genders. We describe
    barriers to sexual and reproductive health care and research
    participation unique to people of marginalized gender identities,
    provide examples of harm resulting from these barriers, and offer
    concrete suggestions for creating inclusive, accurate, and
    respectful care and research environments-which will lead to higher
    quality health care and science for people of all genders.

- abstract: In focusing on fertility preservation and the whiff of
    eugenics in state statutes, this Article aims to make several
    contributions to issues at the intersection of the LGBT and
    reproductive health, rights, and justice movements. This Article
    will show how the reproductive health issues of transgender people
    remain shadowed in the mainstream LGBT movement and reproductive
    health and rights movement. This Article will use reproductive
    justice principles to provide new entry points for LGBT advocates
    and reproductive health and rights advocates to build alliances
    around gender, sexuality, and reproduction by highlighting
    opportunities for reproductive justice advocates to engage on
    reproductive health and rights issues facing transgender people.
    Finally, this Article will anticipate and explore areas in which
    reproductive health, rights, and justice advocates may resist such
    alliances.

- abstract: Transgender people have experienced significant advances in
    societal acceptance despite experiencing continued stigma and
    discrimination. While it can still be difficult to access quality
    health care, and there is a great deal to be done to create
    affirming health care organizations, there is growing interest
    around the United States in advancing transgender health. The focus
    of this commentary is to provide guidance to clinicians caring for
    transgender men or other gender nonconforming people who are
    contemplating, carrying, or have completed a pregnancy. Terms
    transgender and gender nonconforming specifically refer to those
    whose gender identity (e.g., being a man) differs from their female
    sex assigned at birth. Many, if not most transgender men retain
    their female reproductive organs and retain the capacity to have
    children. Review of their experience demonstrates the need for
    preconception counseling that includes discussion of stopping
    testosterone while trying to conceive and during pregnancy, and
    anticipating increasing experiences of gender dysphoria during and
    after pregnancy. The clinical aspects of delivery itself fall within
    the realm of routine obstetrical care, although further research is
    needed into how mode and environment of delivery may affect gender
    dysphoria. Postpartum considerations include discussion of options
    for chest (breast) feeding, and how and when to reinitiate
    testosterone. A positive perinatal experience begins from the moment
    transgender men first present for care and depends on comprehensive
    affirmation of gender diversity.

- abstract: A growing body of literature supports stigma and
    discrimination as fundamental causes of health disparities. Stigma
    and discrimination experienced by transgender people have been
    associated with increased risk for depression, suicide, and HIV.
    Transgender stigma and discrimination experienced in health care
    influence transgender people's health care access and utilization.
    Thus, understanding how stigma and discrimination manifest and
    function in health care encounters is critical to addressing health
    disparities for transgender people. A qualitative, grounded theory
    approach was taken to this study of stigma in health care
    interactions. Between January and July 2011, fifty-five transgender
    people and twelve medical providers participated in one-time
    in-depth interviews about stigma, discrimination, and health care
    interactions between providers and transgender patients. Due to the
    social and institutional stigma against transgender people, their
    care is excluded from medical training. Therefore, providers
    approach medical encounters with transgender patients with
    ambivalence and uncertainty. Transgender people anticipate that
    providers will not know how to meet their needs. This uncertainty
    and ambivalence in the medical encounter upsets the normal balance
    of power in provider-patient relationships. Interpersonal stigma
    functions to reinforce the power and authority of the medical
    provider during these interactions. Functional theories of stigma
    posit that we hold stigmatizing attitudes because they serve
    specific psychological functions. However, these theories ignore how
    hierarchies of power in social relationships serve to maintain and
    reinforce inequalities. The findings of this study suggest that
    interpersonal stigma also functions to reinforce medical power and
    authority in the face of provider uncertainty. Within functional
    theories of stigma, it is important to acknowledge the role of power
    and to understand how stigmatizing attitudes function to maintain
    systems of inequality that contribute to health disparities.

- abstract: "Background: Transgender stigma is rampant within healthcare
    systems in the United States. Transgender adults assigned female at
    birth -- including those identifying as transmasculine or non-binary
    -- face unique barriers, such as stigma when accessing sexual and
    reproductive healthcare labeled as being for \"women.\" However,
    transgender and non-binary people are not passive victims to this
    stigma, and the medical community would benefit from understanding
    the actions this population takes to resist and reduce transgender
    stigma in healthcare. Yet, little research has attempted to
    understand such actions.Aims: This qualitative study aims to explore
    how transmasculine and non-binary adults are actively resisting and
    reducing the impact of transgender stigma in healthcare.Methods:
    In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25
    transmasculine and non-binary adults assigned female at birth who
    were living in a metropolitan area in the mid-Atlantic United
    States. The research team analyzed qualitative interview data using
    content analysis.Results: The 25 participants ranged in age from 21
    to 57, with an average age of 33 years old. Six themes were
    identified related to resisting and reducing transgender stigma in
    healthcare: (a) using social support; (b) persistence to meet one's
    own needs; (c) avoiding mainstream healthcare; (d) advocacy; (e)
    doing one's own research; and (f) strategic disclosure of
    transgender/non-binary identity. We detail how privilege and
    intersectionality connect to the use of these strategies.Discussion:
    Findings indicate there is value in using peer advocates and peer
    health literacy; in developing and nurturing support groups related
    to transgender/non-binary health; in developing \"allies\" employed
    within the healthcare system; in creating and maintaining lists of
    culturally responsive health providers and resources about
    navigating the healthcare system; and in offering trainings related
    to self-advocacy and health-related activism. These findings can be
    used to inform future health prevention and intervention efforts
    with transmasculine and non-binary adults."

- abstract: "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify factors associated
    with the reproductive planning of trans-masculine adults. STUDY
    DESIGN: Between 2015 and 2016, providers enrolled 150
    trans-masculine adults in a sexual health study assessing
    sociodemographics, social support, gender affirmation, sexual
    partnering, and reproductive history and planning. A brief clinical
    interview assessed contraceptive use and concerns. Bivariate and
    multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations
    between participant characteristics and three outcomes: current
    contraceptive use, lifetime pregnancy history and reproductive
    planning. RESULTS: Overall, 37.3% are currently using
    contraceptives; 5.3% have been pregnant; and 20.0% plan to have
    biological children (9.3% plan to become pregnant; 12.0% plan to use
    their oocytes with a surrogate). Participants are less likely to use
    contraceptives if they are students vs. not, have socially affirmed
    their gender vs. not and have a partner vs. are single. Greater
    number of sexual partners is associated with the increased odds of
    contraceptive use. Further, as social support increases, the odds of
    having been pregnant decreases. Participants with a nonbinary gender
    identity are more likely to want to become pregnant than those with
    a binary gender identity, whereas those who have socially affirmed
    their gender are less likely to want to become pregnant than those
    who had not. Finally, participants of color more commonly planned to
    use their oocytes with a surrogate than white participants.
    CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic, gender affirmation, social support and
    sexual partner factors are associated with contraceptive use and
    reproductive history among trans-masculine patients. IMPLICATIONS:
    Healthcare providers must be aware of the diverse reproductive
    histories and pregnancy goals of trans-masculine individuals in
    order to provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare counseling
    and provision. More research is needed to better understand
    contraception and reproduction desires in trans-masculine
    individuals."

- abstract: Gender affirming medical and surgical treatments affect the
    reproductive potential of transgender individuals. Prior to the
    development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), genital
    gender-affirming surgery frequently eliminated a patient's
    reproductive potential. Today, all patients should be counseled on
    their fertility preservation (FP) options before medical and
    surgical transition, yet this appears to seldom occur in practice.
    The following review is the result of a systematic literature search
    of PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar to identify current and future
    FP options, barriers to treatment patients face, practice patterns
    of transgender health care providers, and if there were any
    standardized counseling protocols. Options for transwomen at any
    point in their transition range from simply providing a semen sample
    to be used with assistive reproductive techniques to experimental
    techniques involving testicular cryopreservation followed by in
    vitro initiation of spermatogenesis. Transmen before and after
    starting hormone therapy can pursue any assistive reproductive
    techniques available for ciswomen. Future options currently under
    investigation include ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) with in
    vitro oocyte maturation. In addition to counseling about their FP
    options, patients should be advised prospectively about the
    requirements, process details, the total costs associated with
    achieving pregnancy, and the inherent risks associated with using
    preserved genetic material including risk of failure, and maternal
    and fetal health risks. Transgender patients report using assistive
    reproductive services difficult, due to a lack of dialogue about
    fertility and the lack of information offered to them- presumably
    because their circumstances do not fit into a traditional narrative
    familiar to providers. Physicians and health care providers would
    benefit from better educational tools to help transgender patients
    make informed decisions and better training about transgender
    patients in general, and FP options available to them.

- abstract: "Background: Medical school and residency curricula are
    lacking in content on the care of the transgender patient. As a
    result, many providers do not have enough experience and knowledge
    to adequately care for this patient population. The aim of this
    study was to assess gynecologists' preferences and knowledge base
    with regard to transgender healthcare.Methods: This was a
    cross-sectional survey of obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN)
    providers. An anonymous survey was sent via electronic mail to nine
    academic OBGYN departments across the United States. Survey
    questions were designed to assess provider experience and practice
    environment, education about transgender health practices, personal
    experience with transgender patients, and knowledge base regarding
    current recommendations for the care of gender minority
    patients.Results: Of the 352 providers who received the survey, 141
    responded, for a 40.1% response rate. Of the respondents, 61.7% (87
    of 141) were generalist OBGYNs, and 86% (117 of 136) practiced in an
    academic institution; 80% (113 of 141) did not receive training in
    residency on the care of transgender patients. Time in practice was
    not associated with having learned about transgender care. Only
    35.3% and 29% were comfortable caring for male-to-female and
    female-to-male transsexual patients, respectively; and, 88.7% and
    80.4% were willing to perform screening Pap smears on female-to-male
    transsexual patients and routine breast examinations on
    male-to-female patients, respectively. Eighty-two of 138 providers
    (59.4%) did not know the recommendations for breast cancer screening
    in male-to-female patients.Conclusions: Efforts should be made to
    educate trainees on the important aspects of transgender care, and
    comprehensive guidelines should be published for practicing
    providers."

- abstract: "BACKGROUND: Hormonal therapy and sex reassignment surgery
    (SRS) in transsexual persons lead to an irreversible loss of their
    reproductive potential. The current and future technologies could
    create the possibility for female-to-male transsexual persons
    (transsexual men) to have genetically related children. However,
    little is known about this topic. The aim of this study is to
    provide information on the reproductive wishes of transsexual men
    after SRS. METHODS A self-constructed questionnaire was presented to
    50 transsexual men in a single-center study. RESULTS: The majority
    (64%) of transsexual men were currently involved in a relationship.
    Eleven participants (22.0%) reported having children. For eight
    participants, their female partner was inseminated with donor sperm,
    whereas three participants gave birth before hormonal therapy and
    SRS. At the time of interview, more than half of the participants
    desired to have children (54%). There were 18 participants (37.5%)
    who reported that they had considered freezing their germ cells, if
    this technique would have been available previously. Participants
    without children at the time of investigation expressed this desire
    more often than participants with children (χ²; test: P= 0.006).
    CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that the majority of transsexual men
    desire to have children. Therefore, more attention should be paid to
    this topic during the diagnostic phase of transition and to the
    consequences for genetic parenthood after starting sex reassignment
    therapy."

- abstract: The Standards of Care (SOC) for the Health of Transsexual,
    Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People is a publication of the
    World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). The
    overall goal of the SOC is to provide clinical guidance for health
    professionals to assist transsexual, transgender, and gender
    nonconforming people with safe and effective pathways to achieving
    lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves, in order to
    maximize their overall health, psychological well-being, and
    self-fulfillment. This assistance may include primary care,
    gynecologic and urologic care, reproductive options, voice and
    communication therapy, mental health services (e.g., assessment,
    counseling, psychotherapy), and hormonal and surgical treatments.
    The SOC are based on the best available science and expert
    professional consensus. Because most of the research and experience
    in this field comes from a North American and Western European
    perspective, adaptations of the SOC to other parts of the world are
    necessary. The SOC articulate standards of care while acknowledging
    the role of making informed choices and the value of harm reduction
    approaches. In addition, this version of the SOC recognizes that
    treatment for gender dysphoria i.e., discomfort or distress that is
    caused by a discrepancy between persons gender identity and that
    persons sex assigned at birth (and the associated gender role and/or
    primary and secondary sex characteristics) has become more
    individualized. Some individuals who present for care will have made
    significant self-directed progress towards gender role changes or
    other resolutions regarding their gender identity or gender
    dysphoria. Other individuals will require more intensive services.
    Health professionals can use the SOC to help patients consider the
    full range of health services open to them, in accordance with their
    clinical needs and goals for gender expression.

Many transmasculine people---namely, transgender men and other individuals who are assigned female at birth (AFAB) and whose gender identity falls along the masculine spectrum---count pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood among their lifetime goals (Besse, Lampe, and Mann 2020; Ellis, Wojnar, and Pettinato 2015; Hoffkling, Obedin-Maliver, and Sevelius 2017; Light et al. 2014; MacDonald et al. 2016; Obedin-Maliver and Makadon 2015; Stark et al. 2019; Sterling and Garcia 2020). Though much of the current literature on this topic has focused exclusively on transgender men, efforts to expand this research to include nonbinary AFAB individuals have reported a similar diversity of intentions and desires around fertility and pregnancy (Ellis, Wojnar, and Pettinato 2015; MacDonald et al. 2016; Moseson et al. 2021; Stark et al. 2019). A survey of transgender men following gender-affirming surgery by Wierckx and colleagues (2012) found that 22% of participants had children and 54% desired them in the future. Likewise, a survey of transgender and gender nonconforming youth by Chen and colleagues (2019) found that 60.9% of participants were interested in exploring options for family formation and 35.9% desired biological children. Though research on pregnancy prevalence among transmasculine individuals remains scarce, a survey of 1,694 transgender men and nonbinary AFAB adults by Moseson and colleagues (2021) found that 12% had been pregnant at least once, 11% desired a future pregnancy, and 16% were undecided about their pregnancy goals.

While some transmasculine people may choose to pursue gender-affirming surgeries that impact their fertility (e.g., hysterectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy), not all transmasculine individuals desire fertility-related medical interventions (Abern, Cook, and Maguire 2019). Those who do may opt for oocyte or embryo cryopreservation to preserve their fertility prior to any such surgery (Cheng et al. 2019; Sterling and Garcia 2020), or choose to delay surgery until after pregnancy has been achieved (Ellis, Wojnar, and Pettinato 2015). Though high levels of endogenous testosterone are associated with infertility in people with ovaries, the long-term effects of exogenous testosterone as part of gender-affirming hormone therapy remain understudied. Limited research on transgender men has shown that some individuals can experience pregnancy during or after testosterone use (Light et al. 2014; Obedin-Maliver and Makadon 2015). Indeed, prior research on the pregnancy experiences of transgender men, and transmasculine patients more broadly, has consistently identified a group of respondents who report a lifetime history of testosterone use prior to pregnancy, and many who choose to take a hiatus from testosterone use for the purpose of becoming pregnant (Ellis, Wojnar, and Pettinato 2015; Hoffkling, Obedin-Maliver, and Sevelius 2017; Light et al. 2014; MacDonald et al. 2016).

The decision to pursue pregnancy and childbirth is a complex one regardless of gender identity, and transmasculine individuals cite many of the same motivations as cisgender women for choosing this route to parenthood, such as social recognition, intimacy with a romantic partner, and positive engagement with the capabilities of one's body (Besse, Lampe, and Mann 2020; Ellis, Wojnar, and Pettinato 2015). Nonetheless, limited research shows that transgender men and other transmasculine individuals face unique barriers to pregnancy and childbirth, including cisnormative bias, stigma, and discrimination in health care settings in particular and in society in general, which limit their access to the full spectrum of reproductive health services (Besse, Lampe, and Mann 2020; Ellis, Wojnar, and Pettinato 2015; Hoffkling, Obedin-Maliver, and Sevelius 2017; James et al. 2016; MacDonald et al. 2016; Nixon 2013). Even in the absence of overt discrimination, transmasculine patients frequently report instances of erasure in reproductive health settings due to cisnormative assumptions about who can and will experience pregnancy. These include misgendering by clinical staff, gender-exclusive language on signage and educational materials, or electronic medical records that limit available data fields and billing codes based on a patient's registered gender (Besse, Lampe, and Mann 2020; Moseson et al. 2020). Alongside these barriers, the reproductive choices of transgender individuals are often further restricted by legislation that makes permanent sterilization a requirement for legal recognition of one's gender in some states, potentially forcing individuals to make difficult decisions about their fertility that do not reflect their underlying pregnancy goals (Nixon 2013).

Despite these well-documented barriers, research on pregnancy and fertility decision-making among this population remains limited. Moreover, much of the literature to date has focused on individuals who have already carried a pregnancy to term and thus does not account for the perspectives and experiences of those who are still deciding whether or not to pursue pregnancy within their lifetime (Ellis, Wojnar, Pettinato 2015; Hoffkling, Obedin-Maliver, and Sevelius 2017; Light et al. 2014; MacDonald et al. 2016). Compared to their older counterparts, young adults are both less likely to have undergone gender-affirming surgeries that impact their fertility and more likely to experience an unintended pregnancy while their fertility is preserved, placing them at an important crossroads of reproductive health decision-making (Beckwith et al. 2017; CDC 2016). In order to address this gap in the literature, we conducted a qualitative study to explore the fertility intentions and desires of transmasculine U.S. young adults, as well as the unique multilevel factors that may influence their decision-making around fertility and pregnancy.

Our findings contribute to the limited research on this topic and inform future studies and interventions that enable transmasculine young adults to make informed decisions about their fertility and facilitate access to high-quality, person-centered pregnancy-related services that address the unique reproductive health needs and concerns of this marginalized population.

## Materials and methods

### Participant sampling and recruitment

We used a purposive sampling strategy (Marshall 1996; Patton 2002) to select participants according to the following eligibility criteria: a gender identity along the transmasculine spectrum (e.g., man, transgender man, transmasculine, or nonbinary); assigned a female sex at birth; aged 18--29 years; had an assigned male at birth (AMAB) sexual partner in the last five years; and resides in the greater Boston area. All participants self-identified as transmasculine, alone or in combination with other gender identities, at screening, though participants were surveyed both at screening and at the end of the interview on preferred terms for their gender identity and gender expression to better capture the full diversity of gender identities and expressions in the transmasculine population. Participants were selected as part of a larger study exploring the reproductive health care needs and experiences of transmasculine young adults and were therefore not screened on the basis of their fertility intentions and desires or their pregnancy history. Participants were recruited through community-based, health care, and student organizations, email listservs, and Facebook groups that served transmasculine young adults (Patton 2002), as well as through recruitment ads posted on Craigslist. Additional participants were recruited via a snowball sampling strategy in which participants were asked to inform potentially eligible individuals in their social networks about the study (Arcury and Quandt 1999; King and Horrocks 2010; Marshall 1996; Patton 2002).

### Data collection

We conducted in-depth interviews with 21 transmasculine young adults on topics pertaining to their pregnancy, contraception, and abortion beliefs, attitudes, and experiences. In-depth interviews were conducted in Boston, MA between February and July 2018 using a semi-structured interview guide developed based on the scientific literature (King and Horrocks 2010). The interview guide, which was reviewed by members of the study population and experts in transgender health, consisted of open-ended questions and probes pertaining to the following topics: pregnancy intentions and attitudes, perceptions of and attitudes toward contraceptive and abortion care, contraceptive method preferences and experiences, differential treatment by health care providers in reproductive health care settings, patient-provider communication in the context of contraception, abortion care, and fertility preservation, and health systems barriers to and facilitators of reproductive health care. Interviews were conducted by two members of the study team, a biracial, young adult cisgender woman and a white, young adult transgender man. All interviews were conducted in person in a private room in a university office building or health care facility and lasted between 36 and 66 minutes (*M* = 51). Interviews were conducted in English and audio-recorded upon obtaining written informed consent from participants. Participants received a \$25 gift card for their time. All research activities were approved by the Office of Human Research Administration at Harvard Longwood Medical Area.

### Data analysis

Interview audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and entered into Dedoose (version 8.1.8) for analysis. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a template style thematic analysis approach (Crabtree and Miller 1999; Fereday and Muir-Cochrane 2006; King 2004). Data analysis began with immersion in the data and team-based codebook development and refinement (Crabtree and Miller 1999; MacQueen et al. 1998). The initial hierarchical codebook was developed collaboratively among research team members and included both deductive codes based on the scientific literature and in-depth interview guide and inductive codes based on four interview transcripts. Two independent coders each applied the codebook to these four transcripts to test its fit to the data and ensure consistency in its application. Codes were merged, refined, and discarded, and coding discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus between the two coders and Principal Investigator. The codebook was then applied to the entire sample and periodically refined based on emerging patterns and discussions among research team members. Approximately 20% of transcripts were double-coded by two independent coders to further ensure consistent application of the codebook throughout the coding process (Fereday and Muir-Cochrane 2006; King and Horrocks 2010; MacQueen et al. 1998). For the present manuscript, coded text fragments pertaining to fertility intentions and desires were further organized into themes and sub-themes (Crabtree and Miller 1999; Fereday and Muir-Cochrane 2006; King 2004) and a matrix was used to systematically identify and delineate similarities and differences among study participants (Miles, Huberman, and Saldana 2014). Memo writing, searching for disconfirming evidence, and regular research team discussions were also used to facilitate the identification and refinement of themes and sub-themes (Miles, Huberman, and Saldana 2014).

## Results

### Participant characteristics

Participants (*N* = 21) ranged in age from 18 to 29 years, with a mean age of 25 years (*SD* = 3.1). The majority identified as transgender men (*n* = 9, 42.9%), nonbinary (*n* = 8, 38.1%), or transmasculine (*n* = 5, 23.8%), though these categories were not mutually exclusive, and the majority reported current testosterone use (*n* = 13, 61.9%). Most participants identified as white (*n* = 16, 80.0%), were born in the United States (*n* = 20, 95.2%), and had a bachelor's degree or more (*n* = 17, 81.0%). The majority identified as queer (*n* = 14, 66.7%) and reported having sex with a cisgender man in the past year (*n* = 14, 73.7%). Only one participant had ever been pregnant or received abortion care (*n* = 1, 4.8%), and none had ever given birth. When asked about their lifetime fertility desires, the majority of participants (*n* = 14, 66.7%) reported that they did not want to become pregnant during their lives; however, a substantial minority expressed either uncertainty (*n* = 5, 23.8%) or an unequivocal desire (*n* = 2, 9.5%) to become pregnant in the long term.

### Theme 1: Fertility and pregnancy were often considered in the context of plans for gender-affirming health services

Participants reported a wide range of attitudes towards fertility and pregnancy. Many felt strongly that they did not want to become pregnant. A 29-year-old white, male-identified participant summarized his feelings in this way:

> That's definitely one of those things that has always been a pretty hard no for me, and so I've, since becoming sexually active, been pretty diligent about making sure that was never \[...\] going to come up.

Among those who did not want to become pregnant, some specifically regarded the loss of fertility as a positive potential consequence of pursuing gender-affirming medical services, such as hormone-replacement therapy or surgery. Referring to the experience of signing an informed consent document explaining that testosterone may decrease individuals' ability to conceive, another participant, a 27-year-old transgender man, described:

> I also kind of laughed because, you know, even before I knew that I was trans, I knew that I did not want to be a pregnant person. So that was honestly probably the easiest thing I did that day.

In contrast, several participants expressed a desire to keep their options open, and to consider the possibility of a future pregnancy when structuring their plans for gender-affirming medical services and other health goals. One participant, a 27-year-old white, nonbinary participant who reported wanting to start testosterone use but had not yet done so, stated:

> There's a lot of people who say that there isn't actually a risk of becoming infertile, but there is a chance \[...\] and so I have to decide how attached to that future I feel.

Another 21-year-old multiracial, nonbinary participant echoed this sentiment when discussing considerations around the timing and sequencing of testosterone use and gender-affirming surgery:

> When thinking about whether I should start taking T \[testosterone\] or \[...\] if I ever decide to get top \[chest\] surgery, whether I want to be pregnant and have a baby would definitely be on that list.

While many participants reported uncertainty about their pregnancy-related goals, some cited a strong intention to have biological children and expressed confidence in their ability to navigate any emotional or medical barriers that might arise. As stated by one 26-year-old white transgender man:

> I really want to be a parent. I want to grow a baby. \[...\] I don't really know what sort of gender feelings might show up, but I also know that I'm just going to be really excited to be a parent, and I think that will end up overshadowing any distressing stuff.

Among participants who desired pregnancy, nearly all felt that their gender identity and perceived gender expression would alter the experience of preserving their fertility or carrying a pregnancy to term, and many felt that the process would be more difficult as a result. Anticipated barriers fell into three broad categories: (1) dysphoria and gendered stigma associated with being visibly pregnant as a masculine-identified person, (2) difficulty accessing fertility- and pregnancy-related services due to gendered stigma in health care settings, and (3) lack of trust in health care providers to offer pre-, peri-, and postnatal care that meets the needs of transmasculine patients. These concerns were shared by participants across a wide range of fertility desires and intentions, though participants differed on how surmountable they perceived these barriers to be and how heavily each factored into their decision-making around pregnancy.

### Theme 2: Perceptions of pregnancy as a gendered experience complicated decision-making around fertility and pregnancy

#### Pregnancy as a source of gender dysphoria

Many participants believed that pregnancy and childbirth would be a source of gender dysphoria for them, due to the hormonal and bodily changes inherent in the process. Several participants commented on the need to halt testosterone during and prior to the pregnancy, due to its potential impact on fertility and fetal development (WPATH 2011). As stated by a 26-year-old white, nonbinary participant:

> I think it \[pregnancy\] would be hard and weird. \[...\] I think the biggest thing in my understanding is that you have to be off T for at least a little while before getting pregnant and then for the duration of the pregnancy.

Some participants cited dysphoria as their primary reason for choosing not to pursue pregnancy. One participant, a 27-year-old transgender man, emphasized:

> It's just a whole other animal that if I woke up tomorrow with this crazy urge to be pregnant, I think that would just tear me apart.

For others, the need to halt or delay gender-affirming services was one factor to weigh among many, albeit one about which they expressed some concern. As stated by another participant, a 26-year-old white transgender man:

> I mean, I would \[stop testosterone\] because that's what I would need to do to have children, but menstruating again, I haven't done that in a couple of years, so I'm not looking forward to that.

#### Pregnancy as a driver of cisnormative stigma

For many participants, concerns about the physical symptoms of pregnancy were compounded by cisnormative stigma expressed as fears of ostracization and discrimination that might result if they were to be perceived as pregnant in an androgynous or masculine body. A 28-year-old white transgender man described this as his primary reason for choosing not to preserve his fertility or attempt a planned pregnancy in his lifetime:

> I would have loved to have been able to, but I just don't think I could. Not for the physical piece of it, which I actually would have enjoyed, but for the social aspect of it. \[...\] There are visible changes that happen to your body, and people questioning, and people looking. I just couldn't have done that.

A 27-year-old transgender man shared a similar concern:

> The idea of being a pregnant man is terrifying, you know. I have a lot of anxiety about getting clocked as trans all the time. You know, I'll butch up, like in an Uber, like talking to some dude, you know. I'm constantly afraid of getting clocked as trans or even gay.

#### Pregnancy as a gender-neutral state

Among participants who reported some lifetime desire to become pregnant, many coped with the potential for gender dysphoria and cisnormative stigma by reframing pregnancy as a gender-neutral and strictly biological state. A 28-year-old white transgender man stated:

> It's something that my body can do. My body is uniquely my own and I don't think of it as a female body in any way. It's just like, these are my parts, and this is what they can do.

A 20-year-old Latinx, agender participant echoed this sentiment:

> It's weird because I want to be a mom and I want to be a dad at the same time. \[...\] I feel like my reproductive organs don't make me necessarily feminine because I feel like gender is just so mental.

### Theme 3: Open patient--provider communication was hindered by health care providers' gendered assumptions about patients' pregnancy goals

Although many participants reported that they had not discussed their fertility intentions with a health care provider, those who had done so expressed difficulty communicating their needs due to the gendered assumptions they encountered in health care settings. Participants often found themselves caught between two competing stereotypes: (1) that all individuals with a uterus will want to become pregnant in their lifetime and (2) that all transmasculine individuals will want to avoid pregnancy and eventually seek to end their fertility. While the latter stereotype was more salient for participants seeking to plan for pregnancy or preserve their fertility, the former was raised by participants who wished to end their fertility, emphasizing that gendered stereotypes can be a double-edged sword that does not appropriately serve either group.

#### Provider bias against treatments that may compromise fertility potential

Participants who reported that their providers were not aware, or not fully supportive, of their gender identity expressed frustration that their fertility was often prioritized over their other health care needs, regardless of their stated pregnancy intentions. A 29-year-old white, nonbinary and agender participant who reported no lifetime pregnancy desire shared the experience of seeking care for an unrelated ophthalmological condition:

> I don't know what the medication would have been, but my ophthalmologist was like, 'Well, I could prescribe you this medication, a particular medication that we don't prescribe to women who are pregnant or might become pregnant, and I'd be hesitant to prescribe it to you.' \[...\] That was a weird interaction, because I was like, 'Oh, I could be denied a medication.'

Interactions in which fertility was prioritized over other health care needs were common for participants pursuing a total hysterectomy, a common gender-affirming surgery that results in permanent loss of fertility. This was especially true for participants whose providers were unaware of their gender identity or who wanted the surgery primarily to address other health care needs, such as pregnancy prevention. As stated by one 22-year-old white transgender man:

> I brought it up to my doctor, and I was like, 'Hey, I would like to be sterile indefinitely because I've known I don't want kids forever,' and she's like, 'You're 20. Good luck.'

Similarly, some participants felt pressured to disclose their gender identity to health care providers sooner than they would have liked in order to overcome providers' insistence on preserving the fertility of patients they perceive as women. A 27-year-old white, nonbinary participant described the experience of seeking a hysterectomy to control the symptoms of endometriosis:

> I'd love to get a hysterectomy, and that's where it almost came up on the phone. \[...\] I was like, 'And you know, if I have to get a hysterectomy, that won't be the end of the world,' And she's like, 'Oh, but you'll want to have kids.' \[...\] So that kind of thing. I'll probably have to mention \[my gender identity\].

#### Provider reluctance to address fertility and pregnancy with transmasculine patients

On the other hand, participants who felt that their providers viewed them primarily as transgender men expressed frustration that fertility and pregnancy were no longer considered a relevant part of their health care. As stated by one 27-year-old white, nonbinary participant:

> I think the fact that I present more masculinely does affect things. I think people assume that I'm not interested in physically reproducing. I don't think any providers ask me about \[...\] what I want.

Several participants felt that their providers adopted a one-size-fits-all approach, in which they expected all transmasculine patients to pursue the same set of gender-affirming medical services, without regard for fertility preservation or pregnancy planning. A 24-year-old white, nonbinary participant described their experience this way:

> I think that because providers see me, and it's very clear that they're checking the box 'transman' in their head \[...\] I see an attitude of reduced flexibility around what my needs might be. So it's like, 'Got it. You're a man. You want this, this, and this.' And I'm like, 'Do I, though? Is that what I need?'

Another participant, a 22-year-old white transgender man, expressed a similar sentiment:

> A lot of people are concerned about how the narrative around transition often includes sterilization, and there's sort of this idea that you have to go through all of these steps.

This approach was particularly alienating for participants whose decision-making around fertility preservation and fertility loss had been painful or complex. A 28-year-old white transgender man, who ultimately chose to pursue a hysterectomy, described his provider's behavior in the weeks leading up to the procedure:

> I think she was erring so much on the side of being supportive and like, 'This is great. This is the next step in your \[...\] transition process,' that when I tried to bring up that real sadness it was like, 'Oh, no, no. This is what you need to do.'

Finally, some participants felt pressured to hide the complexity of their emotions around fertility loss during the hysterectomy process, lest their providers question their preparedness for the procedure or deny them access to other gender-affirming medical services in the future. As stated by one 21-year-old multiracial, nonbinary participant:

> I think if I'm going to the doctor and saying something, I know that anything I say could end up in my record and be passed from doctor to doctor, and so I only want to say things that I'm comfortable with that happening with.

Similarly, another participant, a 28-year-old white transgender man, explained:

> I'm afraid that if I voice any \[...\] sadness around it, then they would start questioning, and then the barriers would go into place around being able to access that. So, I feel like in some situations, I've had to say what I know they want to hear, but not necessarily honoring the true feeling behind it.

### Theme 4: Health care providers often lacked knowledge and fluency in transmasculine fertility and pregnancy needs

#### Lack of guidance from providers around potential fertility loss

Many participants felt that they were forced to make decisions about their fertility sooner and with less information than they would have preferred in order to progress toward their gender-affirmation goals. For example, nearly all participants believed that testosterone would decrease their fertility, but most were unsure how immediate or permanent this effect would be. As stated by one 22-year-old white, nonbinary, and genderqueer participant:

> The informed consent that I signed to start \[testosterone\] was ten pages of, 'You may or may not be able to become pregnant. You may or may not. You may or may not.' \[...\] And to sign that at 21 was kind of like, 'Oh, I wish I knew more.'

Another 21-year-old multiracial, nonbinary participant shared their stress at having to navigate fertility preservation at such a young age:

> \[It\] feels really stressful and overwhelming, and like a whole bunch of things that I wish I didn't have to think about because I know that I don't want to have a baby for a while, but because I need to make peace with my body in the meantime I have to deal with it now.

#### Lack of guidance from providers on fertility preservation and pregnancy planning 

For many participants, this stress was amplified by a sense that they could not rely on their health care providers to offer meaningful guidance on fertility preservation options, due to lack of provider knowledge, experience, or comfort discussing pregnancy with transgender patients. A 26-year-old white transgender man reported the following interaction with his surgeon:

> I got chest surgery two years ago and I saw a surgeon who does a lot of chest surgery, and I was like, 'Oh, I'm thinking about having children at some point. Do you know if I can lactate or what would happen?' \[...\] She's like, 'I don't know.' She's like, 'I perform this surgery on women who have a breast reduction \[...\] but yours is obviously a lot more than a reduction, so I don't know.'

Further, several participants expressed frustration that they were warned of the impact testosterone might have on their fertility but given little guidance on how to navigate the potentially complex and expensive process of extracting and preserving their eggs. As stated by one 26-year-old white transgender man:

> They're like, 'Oh, we recommend that you save your eggs,' but \[...\] it's very expensive and that's all they said, so I was just like, 'Okay, we'll see.'

Another participant, a 28-year-old white transgender man, shared a similar experience:

> I was trying to ask around banking of eggs, or what are some options to maintain future fertility, and it was just kind of brushed under the rug like, 'Oh, that's just really expensive. You're not going to be able to do that.'

#### Perceived lack of providers with experience in caring for transmasculine patients during pregnancy

Likewise, several participants expressed concerns about the lack of health care providers with the knowledge, training, and experience to provide transmasculine individuals with high-quality pre-, peri-, and postnatal care. As stated by one 26-year-old white transgender man:

> There's not a lot of trans men who become pregnant and give birth, not that anyone has information about anyway, so I don't \[...\] know where I would go.

Another participant, a 27-year-old transgender man, elaborated on this fear:

> I don't know even if a doctor would understand the full impact of, you know, half a decade on hormones and stuff. \[...\] Even if I could find the most trans pregnancy experienced doctor, how many of those has he or she actually experienced providing care to, you know, maybe two?

Many participants endorsed a general strategy of doing their own research ahead of health care encounters, as well as crowdsourcing advice and information from their communities. As stated by one 26-year-old white nonbinary participant:

> My method is 100% to walk in informed. And so, like, I will crowdsource information from people that I know that would be experts. So, like, I will ask my friends who are doctors and nurses \[...\] and then walk in demanding the things that I need, as opposed to walking in and asking for recommendations, because historically doctors' recommendations are \[...\] poorly informed on the way my life works.

However, pregnancy was viewed as more complex than the typical health care encounter, and at least one participant, a 26-year-old white transgender man, felt that lack of confidence in provider expertise was enough to make him question the feasibility of having biological children:

> I will think a lot about \[...\] where I would get medical care and who would be qualified to help me with that, if there were complications or anything like that. Like the one or two people in Boston who have helped trans men have children may or may not be equipped to deal with things that come up. So, I don't know if I'll do it.

#### Importance of open patient--provider dialog

Among participants who felt confident in their ability to navigate a future pregnancy, several emphasized the importance of finding a provider with whom they had a respectful and trustworthy rapport. Some felt that their history of negative health care experiences could be leveraged to better establish these relationships in the future. As stated by one 24-year-old white, nonbinary participant:

> I think, in general, my experience with \[...\] my current PCP. Again, it's incredibly communicative. I understand that has a great deal to do with her, and also it does have something to do with me walking into the room and being, you know, my capacity to medically advocate for myself unfortunately comes from a lot of poor experience.

Others stressed the need for better representation of transmasculine individuals among health care providers, as well as clinical staff, patient navigators, and peer educators, and expressed a desire to serve as a resource for other patients themselves. As stated by one 29-year-old white, nonbinary participant:

> That's the kind of stuff that I just didn't even realize was missing until recently, where I'm like, you know, it would be really, really nice to take a workshop on my own health led by somebody who's lived it. It would also be nice to feel invited into that process, you know? \[...\] I would love to be available to people.

When asked what approaches they would like to see from health care providers in the future, nearly all participants emphasized the need for open communication between providers and their transmasculine patients around fertility and pregnancy. As stated by one 28-year-old white transgender man:

> I do know some patients don't want to have that conversation, and that's fine, but some definitely do. So being open to having that conversation and knowing what the potential options are around adoption or banking of eggs and those kind of different options. That would've been super helpful to me when I started to transition.

A 24-year-old white, nonbinary participant echoed this sentiment:

> I see a lot of value in providers asking more questions about patients' \[...\] hopes, thoughts, and feelings around their reproductive health and those organ systems or anatomical systems.

Further, participants urged providers to be aware of the diversity of fertility needs, intentions, and desires that exist among transmasculine individuals. A 28-year-old white transgender man shared the following:

> I feel like people get one narrative in their heads and that's that. \[...\] So that's one of my big things with providers is everybody's experience is individual, and so you can't assume one person's individual experience based on collective experience with the community.

## Discussion

Prior research on fertility and pregnancy among transgender men, and transmasculine people more broadly, has chiefly focused on the perspectives of individuals who have already carried a pregnancy to term (Ellis, Wojnar, and Pettinato 2015; Hoffkling, Obedin-Maliver, and Sevelius 2017; Light et al. 2014; MacDonald et al. 2016). Our findings expand upon this literature by exploring the perspectives of transmasculine young adults, many of whom were still grappling with the decision of whether or not to incorporate pregnancy or fertility planning into their life goals. Consistent with prior work (Besse, Lampe, and Mann 2020; Hoffkling, Obedin-Maliver, and Sevelius 2017; Moseson et al. 2021; Wierckx et al. 2012), participants expressed a wide range of attitudes towards pregnancy. A majority felt certain that they did not desire pregnancy in their lifetime, while a small minority had already chosen to structure their plans for gender-affirming medical services and other major life events around an intended future pregnancy. However, by focusing on a younger, childless cohort, our findings offer additional insight into the perspectives of a third group who, though they may have some lifetime desire for pregnancy, feel ambivalent or undecided due to the perceived difficulty of carrying a pregnancy as a transmasculine individual. These perspectives are unlikely to be included in research that singles out individuals who have already given birth, but they offer a valuable outlook on the barriers that may prevent transmasculine individuals from accessing the full spectrum of options for their fertility and reproductive health.

Despite recent strides in visibility and societal acceptance, transgender people still face considerable cisnormative bias, stigma, and discrimination in health care settings (Poteat, German, and Kerrigan 2013). As many as 33% of transgender respondents on the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey reported at least one negative health care experience related to their gender identity in the past year, such as being asked unnecessary or invasive questions by a health care provider, being verbally harassed in a health care setting, or being denied access to health care services (James et al. 2016). Furthermore, as many as 23% reported choosing not to seek a health service when they needed it at least once in the past year for fear of mistreatment related to their gender identity, and 24% reported at least one experience in the past year in which they were required to educate their provider about their needs as a transgender patient (James et al. 2016). These results are not surprising, given the lack of training providers receive that is geared towards transgender patient populations. As of 2020, only 16% of medical schools accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education reported offering a comprehensive LGBTQI+ competency training program, and only 48% reported offering any training on LGBTQI+ patients in their curriculum (Moseson et al. 2020). A 2015 survey of OB-GYNs in the United States found that fewer than half had received education on LGBTQI+ health during their residencies and fewer than 20% had received training on transgender patients (Unger 2015). In this context, pregnancy and childbirth represent a difficult choice for many pregnancy-capable transmasculine and nonbinary individuals, who are routinely forced to navigate a complex set of medical, structural, and psychosocial obstacles with incomplete information and inadequate support from their health care providers.

The present findings document several key barriers faced by transmasculine individuals who are considering pregnancy and highlight concerns about the impact of cisnormative stigma and discrimination in reproductive health care settings. These concerns are in line with the narratives of transgender men, and transmasculine people more broadly, who have experienced pregnancy and childbirth, many of whom report instances of discrimination and stigmatizing behavior from their health care providers, including rudeness, invasive questioning, incorrect name and pronoun use, and denial of key services such as lactation coaching (Light et al. 2014; MacDonald et al. 2016). The exclusion of pregnancy-capable transmasculine people from clinical narratives of pregnancy and childbirth has its roots in repronormativity, the pervasive assumption that childbearing is essential to, and indivisible from, femininity and womanhood (Karaian 2013; Radi 2020). As mainstream visibility of the transgender community has increased, these pressures have been compounded by the evolution of transnormativity, a normative framework that selectively legitimizes transgender narratives and experiences that conform to certain social and medical standards, such as identification with a binary gender, pursuit of gender-affirming medical services in line with that gender, and rejection of the social norms and physical characteristics associated with one\'s assigned sex (Johnson 2016). In the context of reproductive health care, these biases may serve to portray pregnancy and masculinity as fundamentally incompatible, making it difficult for nonbinary and transgender patients to receive support for their gender identity and their fertility goals without undermining one or the other (Karaian 2013; Johnson 2016).

In the present work, participants cited gendered assumptions held by providers about their pregnancy goals, as well as the lack of provider fluency with transmasculine reproductive health needs, as two of the most significant barriers to establishing an open dialog with their providers about their options for fertility and pregnancy. On the one hand, participants whose providers did not know of, or did not fully support, their gender identity often described feeling pressure to prioritize fertility preservation over a variety of other health needs, and, in some cases, to disclose their gender identity sooner than they would have liked in order to justify pursuing medical services that would put their future fertility at risk. On the other hand, participants whose providers were nominally supportive of their gender identity often reported feeling that their providers no longer considered fertility and pregnancy a relevant part of their health care, and, in some cases, reported feeling pressure to hide their fertility desires lest their providers retract their support or question their readiness for gender-affirming medical care. The tension between the repronormative pressure to preserve fertility in some cases and the transnormative pressure to opt out of it in others produces a system in which individuals may feel that they are effectively forced to choose between gaining full recognition of their gender identity in reproductive health care settings and engaging with the reproductive capabilities of their body (Johnson 2016).

Prior research has suggested that access to respectful and non-stigmatizing preconception counseling can significantly reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation among transmasculine patients preparing for pregnancy (Besse, Lampe, and Mann 2020). These findings were echoed by participants in the present work, who emphasized the importance of an open and respectful rapport with a trustworthy provider in their assessment of pregnancy as a feasible goal. Consistent with prior work, participants endorsed care navigation strategies geared towards seeking out more positive patient-provider relationships, such as leveraging negative past experiences for self-advocacy in clinical encounters, relying on peer advocates and social supports to better prepare for difficult conversations, and seeking out transmasculine providers who might better understand their health care needs (Seelman and Poteat 2020). As such, our findings highlight a pressing need to equip health care providers with the training and experience required to offer pre-, peri-, and post-natal care that meets the needs of this population, as well as increase representation of transmasculine individuals in health care roles. Further, our findings emphasize the need for providers to offer flexible care that avoids making assumptions about the fertility intentions and desires of transmasculine patients.

These recommendations would be further bolstered by systems-level interventions that target the wider policy landscape in which reproductive health services are delivered. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), as well as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), have all issued guidance recommending that transgender patients receive counseling on potential fertility loss and fertility preservation options prior to the start of gender-affirming hormone therapy (ACOG 2021; ASRM 2015; WPATH 2011). Despite this, fertility preservation techniques such as oocyte retrieval and cryopreservation remain prohibitively expensive for many patients, with out-of-pocket costs as high as \$9,253 per procedure, in addition to the costs of long-term storage (Lyttle Schumacher et al. 2017). While a number of U.S. states have enacted fertility insurance laws mandating health insurance coverage for fertility-related diagnostic services and infertility treatments, only eleven (i.e., California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Utah) have enacted mandates requiring some insurers to extend coverage to fertility preservation services in cases of medically-induced infertility (Kyweluk, Reinecke, and Chen 2019; RESOLVE 2022). Application of these mandates is often restricted to cases where fertility-compromising treatments are deemed "medically necessary," criteria which were developed in the context of cisgender women undergoing cancer treatments and which may not be understood to apply equally to transmasculine patients in all states (Kyweluk, Reinecke, and Chen 2019). Additional legislation to ensure that existing mandates may be applied in the context of gender-affirming medical care, as well as the development of similar mandates in other states, would represent a crucial step towards making fertility preservation accessible to all who desire it. At the same time, not all transmasculine individuals will choose to pursue gender-affirming medical services that impact their fertility, and existing legislation that makes fertility-compromising treatments, such as certain gender-affirming surgeries, a prerequisite for individuals to gain access to identification that matches their gender identity are discriminatory and should be repealed wherever possible (Nixon 2013).

### Limitations

These results have several limitations. First, although participants reported a diversity of attitudes, intentions, and desires around pregnancy, only one individual in our sample had ever been pregnant and none had given birth. Thus, we were unable to identify or explore any systematic differences between individuals who are willing and able to pursue pregnancy and those who desire pregnancy but do not ultimately pursue it. Second, because these data were gathered as part of a broader study that also examined experiences with contraception, unintended pregnancy, and abortion, participants were only eligible if they reported an assigned male at birth (AMAB) sexual partner within the past five years, a requirement that does not reflect the full range of transmasculine individuals' sexual and romantic relationships or family configurations. Further, because our goal was, in part, to explore transmasculine young adults' experiences navigating reproductive health services, we did not recruit for or include gender diverse AFAB individuals who did not view themselves as transmasculine, alone or in combination with other gender identities, in the present study. Thus, our results may not be applicable to gender diverse people who do not identify as transmasculine and whose experiences may differ from those described here. Finally, a majority of participants in our study sample were white, college-educated individuals enrolled in a private health plan. Nearly all were U.S. born, and all were fluent English speakers. Further all participants resided in or around the greater Boston area. As a result, our findings may not reflect the experiences of transmasculine people of color, individuals with less than a college-level education, or those enrolled in a public health plan or who lack health insurance. Likewise, they may not reflect the experiences of transmasculine individuals who face linguistic or cultural barriers or who reside in regions with different social and political climates and different levels of access to health insurance and health care. Nonetheless, these findings offer insights into the factors that influence decision-making around fertility and pregnancy among transmasculine U.S. young adults, with a particular focus on the decision-making of individuals who have not yet gone through the process of becoming pregnant or giving birth and who are, in many cases, still grappling with the decisions and the barriers described throughout.

## Conclusion

Transmasculine individuals seeking to become pregnant must navigate a complex set of structural, institutional, interpersonal, and psychosocial barriers---both inside and outside of the health care system. Health care providers are well-positioned to reduce the impact of these barriers by offering high-quality, non-stigmatizing pre-, peri-, and post-natal care to all patients regardless of gender identity or expression. Moreover, health care providers should strive to maintain open communication with transmasculine patients about their fertility desires and intentions in the context of other health care needs, such as efforts to minimize gender dysphoria and any plans for testosterone use or gender-affirming surgeries. Likewise, health care institutions should ensure that providers and staff are trained in best practices for supporting transmasculine patients, including the use of gender-inclusive language in patient-provider communication and educational materials, correct name and pronoun use, and reliance on person-centered patient-provider communication that avoids making gendered assumptions about patients' sexual and reproductive health needs, preferences, and experiences.

Providers and institutions alike should be aware of and prepared to address the wider structural- and institutional-level barriers faced by transmasculine patients accessing and navigating reproductive health care, such as difficulty obtaining health insurance coverage for oocyte cryopreservation and other key fertility services. Further, health care institutions should make additional efforts to incorporate transmasculine perspectives into health information and services delivery, including in the form of peer-to-peer sexuality education, peer-led health care navigation programs, collaboration with transmasculine communities in developing patient educational materials, and improved representation and retention of transmasculine health care providers. Systems-level interventions that mandate or incentivize insurance coverage for fertility services, ensure that transmasculine patients are not excluded from such coverage on the basis of gender identity, and discourage the use of proof-of-surgery requirements in applications for updated identification documents should also be considered. Finally, efforts to address institutional cissexism in health care settings by incorporating comprehensive training on the health needs of transmasculine patients, and gender diverse patients overall, into medical and nursing school curricula, continuing education for health professionals, and institutional staff trainings should be used to bolster these strategies, as should efforts at wider advocacy to address structural cissexism in society as a whole.

Despite significant barriers, many transmasculine individuals desire parenthood, and many choose to become pregnant and give birth. A greater understanding of the fertility-related needs, intentions, desires, and experiences of this population, as well as multilevel interventions that advance access to high-quality reproductive health care and address cissexism and other forms of discrimination in health care and other settings, will enable health care providers and organizations to better support the reproductive health, autonomy, and dignity of all people across the full spectrum of gender identities and expressions.
