abstract: |
    Previous research suggests that transgender men and women are more likely to experience body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Few studies have, however, investigated the manner in which body dissatisfaction and eating behavior are affected by the gender affirmation process. To address this issue, semi-structured interviews were conducted with transgender men and women (*N* = 22) recruited from British support groups. Participants were aged 19--71 years. Participant sexuality included heterosexual, homosexual, pansexual, and asexual orientations and all participants identified themselves as white. For both transgender men and women, analyses revealed a shift from a focus on psychological wellbeing in the early stages of gender affirmation to physical wellbeing in the later stages. While body dissatisfaction appeared to dissipate as gender affirmation progressed, a common theme across the gender affirmation process was that both transgender men and women engaged in risky behaviors related to transforming body shape and size. Findings highlight the need to consider the influence of gender affirmation when researching the interconnections between attitudes, behavior, and emotions relating to gender identity.

- abstract: The relation between gender identity and body
    dissatisfaction as well as disordered eating was examined in a
    population-based sample of Finnish adults aged 18 to 44 years
    (N = 1,142). Participants with a conflicted gender identity were
    compared to controls matched on age and biological sex. Participants
    with a conflicted gender identity showed higher levels of body
    dissatisfaction, women with a conflicted gender identity also showed
    more eating disturbance than controls. Among men with a conflicted
    gender identity, male--male sexual experience was associated with
    more body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Among women with a
    conflicted gender identity, female--female sexual experience was
    related to less body dissatisfaction. Possible explanations for
    these findings and the potential clinical implications are
    discussed.

- abstract: The association between disordered eating and gender
    identity was examined in a sample of 20 (11 female-to-male, 9
    male-to-female) transgender Finnish adults, aged 21--62 years. Using
    semi-structured interviews, participants' own understanding of the
    underlying causes of their disordered eating was analyzed, as well
    as the effect of gender reassignment on eating behaviors and
    cognitions. A majority of the participants reported current or past
    disordered eating. Participants most frequently described strive for
    thinness as an attempt to suppress features of one's biological
    gender, or accentuate features of one's desired gender. Gender
    reassignment was primarily perceived as alleviating symptoms of
    disordered eating.

- abstract: "Background and objectives: Understanding behavioral issues
    associated with eating would provide important insight into obesity
    development and possibly procure ways to prevent its occurrence or
    to treat it. This study's objectives were to examine links between
    cognitive, behavioral, and emotional aspects of eating habits and
    chronotype, impulsivity, anxiety, and depression among university
    students.Subjects and methods: The following questionnaires were
    used: TFEQ-R 18, UPPS-short, HADS, and MEQ. All participants gave
    their informed written consent prior to enrolment.Results: Among
    females, increased BMI was associated to uncontrolled eating and
    emotional eating, while in males, BMI was associated to emotional
    eating only. In males, no associations of BMI with impulsivity were
    found while in females they were present. Chronotype scores were
    positively correlated to cognitive restraint and negatively to
    uncontrolled eating among males. No associations were found for
    females. CR was lower among females with higher depression scores,
    while higher anxiety scores were associated to UE among
    males.Conclusions: This was a cross-sectional study of three
    cognitive and emotional domains related to eating habits among
    university students (young adults). Results showed significant
    correlations between BMI, TFEQ-R18 scores, impulsivity and anxiety
    or depression. Future studies should replicate findings in samples
    of individuals with different aspects of eating disorders such as
    binge eating disorder, food addiction or bulimia nervosa."

- abstract: Substance use is prevalent amongst Australians who have
    experienced homelessness, but the social impacts of using substances
    amongst this group are poorly understood. This study uses a
    relational and critical realist approach to understand the role of
    substance use on the social lives of people with lived experience of
    homelessness. A mixed-methods design was used to explore this
    question and assess the experiences of people who have exited
    homelessness. Recruiting across services catering to marginalised
    populations, 110 participants completed a cross-sectional survey.
    Findings showed substance use both socially connected and
    disconnected participants, and that attempting abstinence required
    participants to negotiate and alter their social networks. To
    participants, being a substance "user," or "non-user," was a social
    identity that they actively negotiated to facilitate competing
    social, psychological and material/embodied needs. Participants
    chose to engage and not engage with others to craft a social
    identity they valued, which had the sometimes-negative side-effect
    of limiting potential relationships, leaving users feeling isolated
    from their non-users and a continued imperative to keep using. The
    impacts of substance use on social networks were similar for
    currently and formerly homeless participants, suggesting
    transitioning into housing may not immediately prompt a reduction in
    substance use or influence from substance-using peers. Interventions
    with substance users with lived experience of homelessness would
    benefit from taking a social identity approach that incorporates an
    understanding of the material/embodied aspects of addiction to
    provide a holistic model of care that best supports the relational
    needs of the client.

- abstract: Objectives. We examined relationships between social
    determinants of health and experiences of transgender-related
    discrimination reported by transgender people in Virginia.Methods.
    In 2005 through 2006, 387 self-identified transgender people
    completed a statewide health needs assessment; 350 who completed
    eligibility questions were included in this examination of factors
    associated with experiences of discrimination in health care,
    employment, or housing. We fit multivariate logistic regression
    models using generalized estimating equations to adjust for survey
    modality (online vs paper).Results. Of participants, 41% (n = 143)
    reported experiences of transgender-related discrimination. Factors
    associated with transgender-related discrimination were geographic
    context, gender (female-to male spectrum vs male-to-female
    spectrum), low socioeconomic status, being a racial/ethnic minority,
    not having health insurance, gender transition indicators (younger
    age at first transgender awareness), health care needed but unable
    to be obtained (hormone therapy and mental health services), history
    of violence (sexual and physical), substance use health behaviors
    (tobacco and alcohol), and interpersonal factors (family support and
    community connectedness).Conclusions. Findings suggest that
    transgender Virginians experience widespread discrimination in
    health care, employment, and housing. Multilevel interventions are
    needed for transgender populations, including legal protections and
    training for health care providers.

- abstract: Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely
    acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within
    psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and
    theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We
    outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other
    qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and
    in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions.
    We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic
    analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and
    consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis.
    Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic
    analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful
    and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond
    psychology.

- abstract: "Thematic analysis (TA) is a method for identifying,
    analysing and interpreting patterned meanings or 'themes' in
    qualitative data. In this chapter we outline our approach to TA
    (Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2012, 2013) and demonstrate core processes of
    coding and theme development using worked examples from our study of
    sexual health professionals' views on impediments to sexual health
    in Aotearoa/New Zealand (\\[A/NZ\\], Terry, Braun & Farvid, 2012).
    First we consider the historical development of TA, and the
    proliferation of different approaches to TA, then outline the
    hallmarks of our approach to TA: its unique status as a method,
    rather than a methodology, and its theoretical flexibility."

- abstract: Body mass index (BMI) requirements for gender affirmation
    surgery (GAS) are ubiquitous and vary across providers. Requirement
    variation is not surprising given little data to suggest an
    association between BMI and GAS outcomes. Implementation of
    subjective BMI requirements limits access to GAS and negatively
    impacts patient health and safety. We outline the literature on BMI
    and GAS outcomes, discuss clinical utility of GAS, and summarize
    dangers of prescribing weight loss as a prerequisite for surgery. We
    propose that providers use empirically supported indices of health
    and comorbidity instead of BMI to determine surgical eligibility for
    all patients considering GAS.

- abstract: Black women are particularly vulnerable to the effects of
    European standards of beauty, because these standards emphasize skin
    colors and hair types that exclude many black women, especially
    those of darker skin. Using a social work lens, this article
    explores the black woman's internalization of European beauty
    standards through family, peers, the media, and society, and the
    related outcomes of this internalization on self-perception,
    academic achievement, sexual behavior, employment, marital status,
    and mental health. A review of the research indicates that European
    standards of beauty can have damaging effects on the life
    trajectories of black women, especially those with dark skin,
    primarily in the form of internalized self-hatred. Suggestions are
    made for social work practitioners to address the effects of these
    internalized European beauty standards among black women through
    programming and clinical practice.

- abstract: Background Trans and non-binary children and young people in
    England, UK struggle to gain access to affirming clinical care,
    despite the international research evidence pointing toward this
    best practice approach. Concurrently, they are subject to constant
    discussion in the UK national media and politics, where many
    negative assumptions are made about their needs, experiences and
    clinical provision. Their journey to seek appropriate care has not
    yet been documented.Aims We trace the experiences of trans and
    non-binary children and youth and their families in their decision
    to seek, searches for and experiences with affirmative and
    non-affirmative clinical input for help with their gender.Method 27
    dyadic, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with trans and
    non-binary children and young people and their parents from 13
    families.Results The process of seeking support via National Health
    Service clinical routes in England, UK is beset with lengthy waiting
    lists, issues with geographical inaccessibility, a lack of relevant
    clinical knowledge, and a failure to recognize the value of family
    expertise. Family doctors provide contraceptive hormones in lieu of
    proper access to puberty blocking or gender affirming hormones, and
    most families resort to private care they can ill afford.Discussion
    Training in gender identity and gender dysphoria is recommended for
    both family doctors, and children's mental health services. Gender
    identity development services could be decentralized, with local
    hubs offering more accessible support.

    an adequate conceptualisation of gender as an embodied social

    the face of violence and disease, keeping a trans life afloat in
    practice, facing pressures including rising populism, and making
    transitions work. Familiar models of professional health care are
    not adequate to these issues across much of the world; social action
    and organising are required."

    dysphoria (GD) and eating disorders (ED) in adults, with no cases
    described in the adolescent population. The emphasis on body shape
    in both conditions suggests that there may be some overlap in
    symptomatology. We report two adolescent cases initially diagnosed
    with anorexia nervosa who later met criteria for GD. The drive for
    thinness for the 16-year-old male was associated with a wish to
    achieve a feminine physique whereas there was an emphasis for
    stunted breast growth and a desire for muscularity in the
    13-year-old female. Complexities in presentation, evolution of
    symptoms over time, and the treatment of the two cases are
    discussed. Clinicians should inquire about sexual issues in the
    presentation of ED and should monitor for symptoms of GD, not only
    at initial presentation, but throughout treatment, especially as

- abstract: "Ruminative thought patterns, defined as repetitive negative
    self-focused attention, are considered an avoidant coping strategy
    for managing stress. As trans and nonbinary (TNB) individuals
    commonly experience prejudice and discrimination in response to
    their gender identities (i.e. minority stressors), rumination over
    these stressors may contribute to heightened risk of psychopathology
    in these groups. Although rumination is a general risk factor for
    eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, no studies to date have
    examined whether eating- or gender-related ruminative patterns
    relate to maintenance of ED psychopathology for TNB individuals.
    This cross-sectional study investigated whether levels of rumination
    (both gender-related and ED-specific) mediated the relationship
    between minority stress and ED psychopathology. Method Participants
    were 242 TNB adults (Mage = 24.92, SD = 6.5, Range = 18-70)
    recruited online, who completed measures of minority stress,
    gender-related rumination, ED-specific rumination, and ED
    psychopathology. We used Preacher-Hayes' approach to examine the
    parallel mediation model, with gender-related and ED-specific
    rumination as potential mediators. Results Gender-related rumination
    did not mediate the relation between gender minority stress and ED
    psychopathology, Indirect B = -0.00 \\[95% BCa CI: -0.01, 0.00\\];
    however, ED-specific rumination was significant, indicating partial
    mediation, Indirect B = 0.01 \\[95% BCa CI: 0.00, 0.02\\]. Conclusion
    As gender minority stress and ED-specific rumination relate to ED
    psychopathology, it is essential that clinicians adopt an
    intersectional minority stress framework in understanding ED
    psychopathology among TNB individuals."

- abstract: "This study examined the treatment experiences of
    transgender individuals with eating disorders (EDs). Despite this
    population's elevated risk for EDs, clinicians may be ill equipped
    to treat these clients. Eighty-four transgender individuals with EDs
    completed an online questionnaire about their experiences with ED
    treatment. Inductive thematic analysis produced three themes: role
    of the body in treatment, negative experiences with clinicians, and
    recommendations for treatment centers and providers. Participants
    reported deficits in clinicians' gender competence, resulting in
    beliefs that ED treatment was ineffective, sometimes harmful.
    Further attention to this population's needs is crucial, as
    inadequate care is potentially life threatening."

- abstract: Using an internet-based survey, we examined attitudes toward
    transgender youth in the United States and India, two cultures with
    differences in conceptualizations of gender and treatment of
    transgender individuals in society, law, and religion. We found
    generally positive attitudes toward transgender youth in our U.S.
    (n = 218), but moderately negative ones in our Indian (n = 217),
    sample. Consistent with the literature on prejudice against
    transgender adults in many Western societies, general social
    conservatism in the form of religious beliefs and political
    ideology, gender-specific conservatism in the form of gender binary
    belief, and endorsement of environmental rather than biological
    causes of transgender identity were the best predictors of U.S.
    participants' attitudes, although personal contact with gender and
    sexual minorities also played a role at the bivariate level. These
    findings suggest that the processes underlying prejudice against
    transgender youth are similar to those that foster adult-directed
    transphobia in that cultural context. In contrast, religion-based
    disapproval and environmental causal attributions were the best
    predictors of Indian respondents' attitudes, whereas gender binary
    belief played only a minor role, and political conservatism and
    personal contact no role at all. Our regression analyses accounted
    for considerably more of the variability in U.S. than in Indian
    participants' attitudes, highlighting the need for additional
    (qualitative) work to identify the factors that promote
    transprejudice in India. We discuss these findings in light of
    cross-cultural differences between the two countries in terms of our
    predictors and consider implications for efforts to reduce prejudice
    against transgender youth.

- abstract: "Drawing on survey data from a UK study of trans people and
    mental health, the study presented here reports on the experiences
    of trans people in two health care settings: mental health services
    and gender identity clinics. An analysis of the primarily
    qualitative data indicates that in these settings practitioners tend
    to be poorly informed about trans issues and the realities of trans
    people's lives. The key observations of this study are that
    untreated gender dysphoria (due to delays or refusals of treatment),
    unnecessary and intrusive questioning/tests, prejudicial attitudes
    by service providers, and restrictive treatment pathways, all
    contribute to minority stress which is detrimental to the mental
    health and well-being of trans people."

- abstract: "Males comprise a minority of patients with eating disorders
    (ED). However, men who have sex with men, males with gender identity
    disorder, and transsexual (TS) males are at increased risk for ED.
    Little has been published about the unique treatment needs of TS
    patients with ED. A 19-year-old male-to-female TS patient presented
    with restrictive eating, purging, and weight loss. History revealed
    that her ED ideation and behaviors were strongly intertwined with
    her gender identity. She was admitted and during her hospitalization
    both her ED and TS status were addressed medically. Physicians
    treating patients with ED should be aware of patients' gender
    identities and the ways in which gender identity may impact
    management and recovery. When appropriate, providers should consider
    addressing medical treatment toward gender transition concurrently

    physical and mental health of transgender older adults and to
    identify modifiable factors that account for health risks in this
    underserved population. Design and Methods: Utilizing data from a
    cross-sectional survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
    older adults aged 50 and older (N = 2,560), we assessed direct and
    indirect effects of gender identity on 4 health outcomes (physical
    health, disability, depressive symptomatology, and perceived stress)
    based on a resilience conceptual framework. Results: Transgender
    older adults were at significantly higher risk of poor physical
    health, disability, depressive symptomatology, and perceived stress
    compared with nontransgender participants. We found significant
    indirect effects of gender identity on the health outcomes via fear
    of accessing health services, lack of physical activity,
    internalized stigma, victimization, and lack of social support;
    other mediators included obesity for physical health and disability,
    identity concealment for perceived stress, and community belonging
    for depressive symptomatology and perceived stress. Further analyses
    revealed that risk factors (victimization and stigma) explained the
    highest proportion of the total effect of gender identity on health
    outcomes. Implications: The study identifies important modifiable
    factors (stigma, victimization, health-related behaviors, and social
    support) associated with health among transgender older adults.
    Reducing stigma and victimization and including gender identity in
    nondiscrimination and hate crime statutes are important steps to
    reduce health risks. Attention to bolstering individual and
    community-level social support must be considered when developing
    tailored interventions to address transgender older adults' distinct
    health and aging needs."

- abstract: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer people of color
    (LGBTQ-POC) are regularly exposed to unique and contextual forms of
    prejudice and stigma, which have been linked to stress and increased
    likelihood of mental and physical health problems. In order to
    better understand the experiences of this multiply marginalized
    population, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11
    LGBTQ-POC to examine how they describe their experiences with
    identities, communities, discrimination, and health. Data consisted
    of verbatim interviews, which were guided by intersectionality
    theory and minority stress theory and analyzed using interpretive
    phenomenological analysis. Using intersectionality theory, this
    study addresses the simultaneity of oppressions and the ways in
    which having different combinations of marginalized identities may
    impact LGBTQ-POC well-being. Common issues discussed by respondents
    include disconnect from communities, relationships between
    identities, coming out, and stress and anxiety. The primary concepts
    introduced in this study include positive intersectionality and come
    out stress.

- abstract: "In this article, I argue that the medical conceptualization
    of gender identity in the United States has entered a \"new regime of
    truth.\" Drawing from a mixed-methods analysis of medical journals, I
    illuminate a shift in the locus of gender identity from external
    genitalia and pathologization of families to genes and brain
    structure and individualized self-conception. The sexed body itself
    has also undergone a transformation: Sex no longer resides solely in
    genitalia but has traveled to more visible parts of the body,
    implicating racialized aesthetic ideals in its new formulation. The
    re-imagining of gender identity as genetically and neurologically
    inscribed and the expanding locus of sex correspond to an inversion
    of the relationship between gender identity and the sexed body as
    well as shifts in medical jurisdiction. Whereas psychiatrists in the
    1960s, '70s, and '80s understood gender as stemming from genital
    sex, the less popular idea that gender identity precedes the sexed
    body has gained traction in recent decades. If gender identity once
    derived from the sexed body, the sexed body must now be brought into
    alignment with gender identity. The increasing legitimacy of
    self-defined gender identity, the expanding definition of racialized
    sex, and the inversion of the sex--gender identity relationship
    elevates the role of surgeons in producing racialized and sexed
    bodies."

- abstract: "The impact of societal femininity ideals on disordered
    eating behaviors in non-transgender women has been well described,
    but scant research has explored these processes among transgender
    women. The present study explored weight and shape control behaviors
    among low-income, ethnically diverse young transgender women at high
    risk for HIV or living with HIV in a Northeastern metropolitan area.
    Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 21
    participants (ages 18--31 years; mean annual income \\<\\$10,000;
    ethnic identity: Multiracial \\[n = 8\\], Black \\[n = 4\\], Latina
    \\[n = 4\\], White \\[n = 4\\], Asian \\[n = 1\\]). Interviews were
    transcribed and double-coded using a template organizing method,
    guided by ecosocial theory and a gender affirmation framework. Of 21
    participants, 16 reported engaging in past-year disordered eating or
    weight and shape control behaviors, including binge eating, fasting,
    vomiting, and laxative use. Study participants described using a
    variety of strategies to address body image concerns in the context
    of gender-related and other discriminatory experiences, which shaped
    participants' access to social and material resources as well as
    stress and coping behaviors. Disordered weight and shape control
    behaviors were discussed in relation to four emergent themes: (1)
    gender socialization and the development of femininity ideals, (2)
    experiences of stigma and discrimination, (3) biological processes,
    and (4) multi-level sources of strength and resilience. This
    formative study provides insight into disordered eating and weight
    and shape control behaviors among at-risk transgender women,
    illuminating avenues for future research, treatment, and public
    health intervention."

- abstract: With growing visibility of diverse gender identities and
    communities, it is necessary for clinicians involved in eating
    disorder prevention, screening, and treatment to create affirming
    spaces for transgender and gender non-binary (T/GNB) patients and
    clients. Further underscoring this need, there is mounting evidence
    that T/GNB populations are at 2--4 times greater risk of
    experiencing eating disorder symptoms compared to their cisgender
    (i.e., non-transgender) counterparts. Although research on the risk
    and protective factors underlying these health inequities is
    growing, more epidemiologic and clinical research is urgently
    needed. This chapter synthesizes the current state of the science
    and provides recommendations for clinicians at all levels of
    familiarity with T/GNB populations, including clinicians who are
    just beginning to think about gender diversity in their practice as
    well as those who have expertise in this area and wish to identify
    next steps for their clinical care, research, and/or advocacy in the
    field.

- abstract: "Substance use disorders are a major source of morbidity and
    mortality in the United States. National data comparing the
    prevalence of substance use disorder diagnoses (SUDDs) among
    transgender and cisgender individuals are lacking in the United
    States.To investigate the prevalence of SUDDs among transgender and
    cisgender adults and to identify within-group and between-group
    differences by age, gender, and geographic location.This
    cross-sectional study used the OptumLabs Data Warehouse to analyze
    deidentified claims from approximately 74 million adults aged 18
    years or older enrolled in commercial or Medicare Advantage
    insurance plans in 2017. A total of 15 637 transgender adults were
    identified based on a previously developed algorithm using a
    combination of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
    Revision (ICD-10) transgender-related diagnosis and procedure codes
    and sex-discordant hormone prescriptions. A cohort of 46 911
    cisgender adults was matched to the transgender cohort in a 3:1
    ratio based on age and geographic location.SUDDs, based on ICD-10
    codes, were assessed overall and compared between transgender and
    cisgender cohorts and by geographic region (ie, Northeast, Midwest,
    South, and West); age groups (eg, 18-25, 26-30, 31-35 years), and
    gender (ie, transfeminine \\[TF; assigned male sex at birth, identify
    along feminine gender spectrum\\], transmasculine \\[TM; assigned
    female sex at birth, identify along masculine gender spectrum\\],
    male, and female).In this study of 15 637 transgender adults (4955
    \\[31.7%\\] TM) and 46 911 cisgender adults (23 664 \\[50.4%\\] female),
    most (8627 transgender adults \\[55.2%\\]; 25 882 cisgender adults
    \\[55.2%\\]) were aged between 18 and 40 years, and 6482 transgender
    adults (41.5%) and 19 446 cisgender adults (41.5%) lived in the
    South. Comparing transgender to cisgender groups, significant
    differences were found in the prevalence of a nicotine (2594
    \\[16.6%\\] vs 2551 \\[5.4%\\]; P &lt; .001), alcohol (401 \\[2.6%\\] vs
    438 \\[0.9%\\]; P &lt; .001), and drug (678 \\[4.3%\\] vs 549 \\[1.2%\\];
    P &lt; .001) SUDDs. Among transgender adults, cannabis was the most
    prevalent drug SUDD (321 \\[2.1%\\]), followed by opioid SUDD (205
    \\[1.3%\\]) and cocaine SUDD (81 \\[0.5%\\]), whereas among cisgender
    adults, cannabis and opioid SUDDs were equally prevalent (cannabis,
    186 \\[0.4%\\]; opioid, 207 \\[0.4%\\]), followed by cocaine SUDD (59
    \\[0.1%\\]).In this study, the prevalence of SUDDs was significantly
    elevated among transgender adults relative to their cisgender peers.
    These findings underscore the need for culturally tailored clinical
    interventions to treat substance use disorder in transgender
    populations."

- abstract: Over the last decade, there has been an increase in global
    and local policy protections on the basis of gender identity and
    expression in education and a recent spate of coverage of
    transgender students on Australian television and news media. This
    paper explores the school experiences of Australian transgender and
    gender diverse students', with particular consideration of
    recognition of their gender identity in documentation, experiences
    of puberty and sexuality education, treatment by staff and students,
    and other forms of provision. It reports on the findings of a 2013
    study which combined a survey of 189 transgender and gender diverse
    Australian students aged 14--25 years, with 16 online interviews
    with members of this group. The study was informed by a community
    advisory group which included a range of transgender, gender diverse
    and intersex people. Findings include both quantitative and
    qualitative data, detailing a trend towards more disruptive, fluid
    and inconsistent identifications by members of this student group,
    and a diversification of their needs at school. Student advocacy on
    topics including sexuality and puberty education was shown to be
    common and also useful in improving individual well-being and social
    outcomes. We offer some reflections towards more useful school
    practices and future research.

- abstract: A review of the literature on racial differences in body
    image in Black and White women indicates body image dissatisfaction
    is more common in White females than Black females. However, Black
    women are not protected from body image issues. Research on body
    image concerns specifically related to Black women is limited. The
    present study involves focus group and individual interviews
    conducted with 16 Black women. Data were analyzed using qualitative
    methodology. Results indicate 6 major themes, with shapely and
    curvaceous ideal body image standards within the Black community as
    the most prevalent theme across data sources. Therapeutic
    implications emphasize recognition of culture-specific ideal
    standards of beauty, as well as the influence of external factors
    such as men, family, peers, and media on Black women's
    self-evaluations.

- abstract: We found that during their journey of transition from male
    to female, people with gender identity disorder do not report higher
    levels of drive for thinness, bulimia or body dissatisfaction than
    the general population or people with eating disorders on the Eating
    Disorder Inventory. Instead, they report significantly lower levels
    of drive for thinness and bulimia when compared to biological males
    and females on the same questionnaire. Concerns about their body
    dissatisfaction were reduced very significantly after surgery as
    might have been expected. We also found significant levels of
    perfectionism, identified as excessive personal expectations for
    superior achievement on the Eating Disorders Inventory, in people
    with gender identity disorder when compared to the general
    population as well as to people with eating disorders. As far as we
    are aware, this is the first study to report such a finding. Some
    reasons for this are considered in this paper.

- abstract: "The purpose of this study was to explore the lived
    experiences of transgender men related to nutrition, exercise, and
    body image throughout their transition. Our objectives were to 1)
    describe changes in attitudes and awareness related to nutrition,
    exercise, and body image throughout the process of transitioning, 2)
    explore the persistence of feminine or masculine schemas related to
    these variables, and 3) capture the role of nutrition and exercise
    as physical embodiments of gender expression.We utilized narrative
    inquiry and a hybrid biographical, psychological and linguistic
    approach. The primary investigator conducted semi-structured
    interviews with ten adult transgender men. Each interview was
    crafted into a brief narrative and major themes were constructed
    across the narratives. Strategies of trustworthiness included member
    checking of the narratives and preliminary results, triangulation of
    multiple theories, reliance on four research team members in data
    analysis, and use of verbatim quotes.Five themes were constructed:
    Coming to life as a man; caring for a new body; expected and actual
    changes with hormone therapy; health information seeking; balancing
    the demands of daily life. Each theme was supported by three to five
    subthemes. A sample of the ten narratives reads: \"CM is a 33
    year-old transgender male and has been on hormone therapy for over
    five years. He gained about 60 pounds after starting hormone therapy
    due to an increase in appetite and a genuine desire to have a larger
    body size. He describes, \"I'm not going to blow over and am just
    more rugged, solid, stocky\" and going from \"invisible to visible.\"
    CM is now motivated to care for his health and longevity. He
    explains, \"I really like my life now. It feels great! I get to be a
    husband. I get to do these things. I get to live my life as I
    am.\"Transgender men's relationship with nutrition and exercise
    generally improved throughout their transition second to improved
    body congruence and increased motivated to care for a new body.
    Healthcare providers can work with their transgender patients to
    better understand their goals for transitioning related to body size
    and shape, and can communicate how nutrition and exercise may play a
    role.This project was funded through an intramural grant at Saint
    Louis University."

- abstract: "The goal of this study was to examine the ways in which
    transgender youth experience their bodies with regard to gender and
    body size. Ninety transgender youth and young adults completed
    in-depth interviews in eight metropolitan areas of the United
    States, Canada, and Ireland. Using a queer perspective, qualitative
    analyses revealed two broad conceptual categories: body
    dissatisfaction and body satisfaction. Within these categories,
    participants focused on body issues related to gender
    characteristics and body size. Findings revealed evidence of
    self-criticism and social distress related to body image
    dissatisfaction and self-acceptance and social acceptance related to
    body image satisfaction. Data demonstrated how gender, body size,
    and the intersection of gender and body size influenced personal
    perceptions of body dissatisfaction and satisfaction. Developmental
    processes were evident: participants further along in consolidating
    a gender identity described gaining a sense of social awareness,
    self-acceptance, and body satisfaction reflecting a sense of
    resilience."

- abstract: Research suggests that transgender people face high levels
    of discrimination in society, which may contribute to their
    disproportionate risk for poor health. However, little is known
    about whether gender nonconformity, as a visible marker of one's
    stigmatized status as a transgender individual, heightens trans
    people's experiences with discrimination and, in turn, their health.
    Using data from the largest survey of transgender adults in the
    United States, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N =
    4,115), we examine the associations among gender nonconformity,
    transphobic discrimination, and health-harming behaviors (i.e.,
    attempted suicide, drug/alcohol abuse, and smoking). The results
    suggest that gender nonconforming trans people face more
    discrimination and, in turn, are more likely to engage in
    health-harming behaviors than trans people who are gender
    conforming. Our findings highlight the important role of gender
    nonconformity in the social experiences and well-being of
    transgender people.

- abstract: This report documents two transgendered biological males who
    met criteria for an eating disorder, who interchangeably reported
    periods of endorsing masculine and feminine gender identities,
    allowing an exploration of how their preferred gender orientation
    impacted their eating disorder psychopathology. This report suggests
    that the divergence of body image psychopathology amongst men may be
    impacted by gender role orientation, which is consistent with a
    developing body of research.

- abstract: Evaluating the intercoder reliability (ICR) of a coding
    frame is frequently recommended as good practice in qualitative
    analysis. ICR is a somewhat controversial topic in the qualitative
    research community, with some arguing that it is an inappropriate or
    unnecessary step within the goals of qualitative analysis. Yet ICR
    assessment can yield numerous benefits for qualitative studies,
    which include improving the systematicity, communicability, and
    transparency of the coding process; promoting reflexivity and
    dialogue within research teams; and helping convince diverse
    audiences of the trustworthiness of the analysis. Few guidelines
    exist to help researchers negotiate the assessment of ICR in
    qualitative analysis. The current article explains what ICR is,
    reviews common arguments for and against its incorporation in
    qualitative analysis and offers guidance on the practical elements
    of performing an ICR assessment.

- abstract: Among LGBTQ people, those who are gender nonconforming (GNC)
    may be at heightened risk of both discrimination and
    underutilization of healthcare---yet little is known about what
    happens during healthcare encounters to compel GNC individuals to
    continue or avoid seeking future care. This study qualitatively
    examines the healthcare experiences of a racially diverse sample of
    34 adult LGBTQ cis women, transgender men, and nonbinary individuals
    in a metropolitan area of the United States who do not conform to
    dominant biomedical schemas of sex and gender. GNC individuals
    experience embodied disruption in medical settings when patients are
    mis/recognized; providers respond to disruption in ways that further
    distress patients. Broadly, participants report similar experiences
    across racial and gender identities, but patients manage disruption
    somewhat differently depending on their embodied positions to gender
    norms. This study contributes to literature of stress, stigma, and
    sex, gender, and sexuality within medicine by illuminating how
    stigmatizing healthcare interactions deter LGBTQ individuals from
    seeking healthcare. Findings point to the importance of considering
    both structural factors and embodied visibility in future research
    addressing how stigma and discrimination manifest within health
    settings to disadvantage LGBTQ groups.

- abstract: In the U.S., the weight of LGBTQ people---and sexual
    minority women in particular---is a key focus for those addressing
    sexual and gender minority health disparities. Sociomedical stigma
    related to both fat and sexuality, however, complicates
    patient-provider perceptions and discussions about weight and
    health. I analyzed data from interviews with LGBTQ patients,
    healthcare employees, and observations at a LGBTQ healthcare
    organization to reveal how weight bias becomes a barrier to care for
    LBQ cisgender women, transgender men, and nonbinary people assigned
    female. Understood by patients as similar to "trans broken arm
    syndrome,\"---wherein providers attribute health concerns of trans
    people to minority gender identities and gender affirming
    care---patients report "fat broken arm syndrome," wherein providers
    are perceived to attribute patient health concerns to weight.
    Patients interpret weight bias as intersectional stigma---related to
    multiple marginalized identities and embodiments---that puts their
    health at risk. Healthcare professionals make sense of risk,
    however, through competing fat frames. Although patient narratives
    suggest the promise of utilizing stigma-reduction approaches, many
    providers---typically those who do not share patient
    standpoints---emphasize the importance of framing fat as an urgent
    health risk in order to "do no harm." This case advances knowledge
    by demonstrating the relational process through which interventions
    designed to ameliorate health disparities may inadvertently
    discourage marginalized, "at-risk" patients from healthcare access
    and adherence.

- abstract: The goal of the study was to examine health indicators in
    relation to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) among
    university students in five ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia,
    Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam). In a cross-sectional survey
    randomly selected 3262 undergraduate university students (Mean
    age=20.5 years, SD=1.6) responded to a questionnaire including
    health indicators, gender identity and sexual orientation. Five
    percent (153/3262) of eligible participants considered themselves as
    LGBT youths; 23.5% of them were severely depressed, 31.4% had PTSD
    symptoms, 40% had suicidal ideation, 35.3% had made a suicide
    attempt, 28.6% were hazardous or harmful alcohol users, 14.0% had
    used illicit drugs in the past 12 months, and 46.4% engaged in
    pathological internet use. LGBT identity predicted severe depression
    (AOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9, 4.3), suicide attempt (AOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1,
    2.9), hazardous or harmful alcohol use (AOR 1.7, 95% 1.1, 2.5),
    illicit drug use (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4, 4.0), and pathological
    internet use (AOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1, 2.1), adjusting for age, sex,
    study year, martial status, religion, subjective economic status,
    social support, and country. The study confirmed sexual and gender
    mental health disparity. LGBT university students should be
    prioritized for mental health and addictive behaviour prevention and
    intervention.

- abstract: For those identifying as transgender or gender nonconforming
    (TGNC), the support of others can be instrumental in mitigating the
    challenges associated with cross-gender transition and
    identification. Social support and connectedness to the TGNC
    community can positively impact psychological well-being, facilitate
    resilience, and buffer against external stigmatization, prejudice,
    and discrimination (Frost & Meyer, 2012; Hendricks & Testa, 2012).
    The present study seeks to improve understanding of relationships
    among general social support (GSS), trans community connectedness
    (TCC), depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. The inclusion of 2
    forms of social support allows for greater examination of the
    differential impact of perceived general support (i.e., from both
    cisgender and TGNC friends and family members) and TGNC-specific
    social support (i.e., feeling connected to other TGNC people). To
    honor the diversity within the TGNC community, the impact of social
    support was examined among TGNC participants differentiated by
    gender identity, ethnicity, and living environment. As part of the
    Internet-based Trans Health Survey, standardized measures of
    depression, generalized anxiety, and social support were
    administered to 865 TGNC adults. For both trans male spectrum (TMS)
    and trans female spectrum (TFS) participants, general social support
    was significantly negatively associated with symptoms of anxiety and
    depression. However, the negative correlation between trans
    community connectedness and mental health symptoms was significant
    only for TFS participants. Variations in perceived TCC among
    ethnicity and living environment groups---distinguished by gender
    identity---are also explored. Finally, targets for future minority
    stress and social support research with the TGNC population are
    discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights

- abstract: "OBJECTIVE: This study examined experiences of weight
    stigmatization, sources of stigma, coping strategies, psychological
    functioning, and eating behaviors in a sample of 2671 overweight and
    obese adults. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The total sample was
    partitioned into two subsamples for investigation. Sample I was
    comprised of 2449 adult women, and Sample II was a matched sample of
    adult men and women (N = 222) that was disaggregated to investigate
    gender differences. Both samples completed an online battery of
    self-report questionnaires measuring frequency of weight
    stigmatization and coping responses to deal with bias, the most
    common sources of the bias, symptoms of depression, self-esteem,
    attitudes about weight and obesity, and binge eating behaviors.
    RESULTS: Experiences of weight stigmatization, in many forms and
    across multiple occasions, was common in both samples. A variety of
    coping strategies were used in response. More frequent exposure to
    stigma was related to more attempts to cope and higher BMI.
    Physicians and family members were the most frequent sources of
    weight bias reported. No gender differences were observed in types
    or frequency of stigmatization. Frequency of stigmatization was not
    related to current psychological functioning, although coping
    responses were associated with emotional well-being. DISCUSSION:
    These findings raise questions about the relationship between stigma
    and psychological functioning and have important implications for
    obesity treatment and stigma reduction intervention efforts, both of
    which are discussed."

- abstract: Transgender adolescents (TGAs) face many of the same
    sociocultural and biological influences on body dissatisfaction and
    disordered eating as cisgender peers. Additionally, TGAs experience
    unique body- and gender-related concerns. The purpose of this study
    is to explore the nuances of gender identity, gender transitioning,
    body image, and disordered eating among TGAs. Case summaries and a
    synthesis of key themes are presented from interviews with nine TGAs
    aged 16--20 (Mage = 17). All participants reported engaging in at
    least one behavior to change their weight or shape. Consistent with
    a theoretical biopsychosociocultural model we proposed, TGAs
    described body dissatisfaction and disordered eating related to
    transgender-specific factors (e.g., behaviors aimed at minimizing
    secondary sex characteristics) and broader developmental and
    sociocultural factors. Some participants reported improvements in
    body image and disordered eating following gender transition. The
    interviews highlight complex associations among gender identity,
    gender transitioning, body image, and disordered eating during
    adolescence, suggesting that disentangling transgender-specific
    factors from other individual factors is difficult. These findings
    may guide future research on the prevalence and functions of
    disordered eating among TGAs and point to a unique set of needs for
    effective detection and treatment of concurrent gender incongruence,
    body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating.

- abstract: "Purpose: Nutrition care guidelines for the transgender
    population do not exist, despite significant nutrition-related
    clinical and psychosocial considerations. Social networking sites
    (SNSs) provide multidirectional communication and have expanded in
    popularity among transgender users as a resource for health
    information and support. The nature of the content shared among the
    online transgender community is unknown, but may suggest the
    nutrition-related areas that are of most importance to the
    transgender population. The objective of this qualitative
    netnography was to describe the food and nutrition messages shared
    among the transgender community using video blogs (vlogs) on the
    SNS, YouTube.Methods: Public vlogs were assessed using the constant
    comparative method. Pseudoquantitative methods were used to capture
    the prevalence of each subtheme; quotes were documented verbatim.
    Data were collected from transgender users' public vlogs (n=30)
    self-published on YouTube from 2013 to 2018.Results: Six major
    themes were generated from the data analysis. These included the
    following: functions of diet and exercise; diet and exercise
    philosophies; \"how to\"how to vlogs; advice for success; using
    dietary supplements; and effects of hormone therapy.Conclusions:
    Nutrition-related messages are widely shared among the online
    transgender community through YouTube. The identified themes reflect
    topics of interest and expressed needs of transgender individuals.
    SNSs provide health care providers with a platform to improve
    patient education and health literacy. Health care providers may
    actively engage in online discussions to build trust, answer
    questions, and provide a source of accurate and evidence-based
    information."

- abstract: Experiences of stigma, discrimination, and violence as well
    as extreme health disparities and high rates of sexual risk behavior
    and substance use have been well-documented among transgender women
    of color. Using an intersectional approach and integrating prominent
    theories from stigma, eating disorders, and HIV-related research,
    this article offers a new framework for conceptualizing risk
    behavior among transgender women of color, specifically sexual risk
    behavior and risky body modification practices. This framework is
    centered on the concept of 'gender affirmation,' the process by
    which individuals are affirmed in their gender identity through
    social interactions. Qualitative data from 22 interviews with
    transgender women of color from the San Francisco Bay Area in the
    United States are analyzed and discussed in the context of the
    gender affirmation framework.

- abstract: Sexual distress is associated with a variety of negative
    outcomes. Unique contributors to sexual distress exist among
    transgender individuals. The current study examined the impacts of
    gender-affirming interventions (i.e., hormone therapy \[HT\],
    gender-affirmation surgery \[GAS\]) and body satisfaction on sexual
    distress among 317 transgender adults recruited nationally to
    participate in an anonymous online survey. As expected, individuals
    who had received HT and/or GAS reported better body satisfaction
    compared to those who wanted these interventions but had not yet
    received them. Sexual distress did not differ by transition status.
    As hypothesized, time since transition began was positively
    associated with body satisfaction, and there was an indirect
    relationship between time since transition began and sexual distress
    through body satisfaction. These results replicated findings in the
    extant literature suggesting that body satisfaction is improved by
    GAS. Furthermore, this was the first study of which we are aware to
    examine the role of time since transition began with respect to body
    satisfaction and the resulting impact on sexual distress. Results
    from this study may have clinical implications that could help
    improve the gender-affirmation experience for transgender
    individuals.

- abstract: "Patients with gender dysphoria and patients with eating
    disorders often experience discontent with their bodies. Several
    reports have recognized the co-occurrence of these two conditions,
    typically in adults who identify as transgender females and desire a
    more feminine physique. This case report, in contrast, describes a
    16-year-old patient with a female sex assigned at birth who first

    eating disorder and overall well-being. This case is one of only a

- abstract: Objective Research examining the prevalence and severity of
    eating-related psychopathology in transgender and gender nonbinary
    individuals is limited. This study examined how identity development
    and minority stress relate to the presence of disordered eating
    behaviors and cognitions in transgender and gender nonbinary
    individuals, and improvement at one-year follow-up. Methods Data
    come from a multi-site, longitudinal study of transgender and gender
    nonbinary individuals (n = 287) and includes assessment of
    transgender congruence, receipt of gender-affirming care, minority
    stress, and disordered eating symptoms. Hierarchical multivariable
    logistic regression was used to test for associations between
    identity development, minority stress, and eating-related
    psychopathology. Results Eighty-three participants (28.9%) met
    criteria for current eating-related psychopathology. Loss of control
    eating was the most commonly endorsed behavior, followed by
    laxative, diuretic, or other medication use, and compulsive
    exercise. Higher transgender congruence was associated with lower
    odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.55--0.94),
    whereas increased internalized transphobia was associated with
    greater odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 1.41, 95%
    CI = 1.04--1.91). Participants with eating-related psychopathology
    had greater odds of having received gender-affirming psychotherapy
    in the year prior to assessment (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.32--4.14).
    Conclusions Results suggest that gender identity development and
    internalized transphobia are associated with eating-related
    psychopathology in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals.
    Mental health providers should consider assessing all transgender
    and gender nonbinary individuals for eating-related psychopathology
    and unique risk factors associated with disordered eating, including
    low transgender congruence and internalized transphobia.

- abstract: "Purpose Research has documented high rates of disordered
    eating for lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth, but prevalence and
    patterns of disordered eating among transgender youth remain
    unexplored. This is despite unique challenges faced by this group,
    including gender-related body image and the use of hormones. We
    explore the relationship between disordered eating and risk and
    protective factors for transgender youth. Methods An online survey
    of 923 transgender youth (aged 14--25) across Canada was conducted,
    primarily using measures from existing youth health surveys.
    Analyses were stratified by gender identity and included logistic
    regressions with probability profiles to illustrate combinations of
    risk and protective factors for eating disordered behaviors. Results
    Enacted stigma (the higher rates of harassment and discrimination
    sexual minority youth experience) was linked to higher odds of
    reported past year binge eating and fasting or vomiting to lose
    weight, while protective factors, including family connectedness,
    school connectedness, caring friends, and social support, were
    linked to lower odds of past year disordered eating. Youth with the
    highest levels of enacted stigma and no protective factors had high
    probabilities of past year eating disordered behaviors. Discussion
    Our study found high prevalence of disorders. Risk for these
    behaviors was linked to stigma and violence exposure, but offset by
    social supports. Health professionals should assess transgender
    youth for disordered eating behaviors and supportive resources. ©

- abstract: High levels of body dissatisfaction have already been
    reported in the trans population; however, the root of this
    dissatisfaction, and its association with eating disordered
    behaviours, has not been studied in-depth. This study aims to assess
    eating disorder risk by comparing 200 trans people, 200 people with
    eating disorders and 200 control participants' scores on three
    subscales of the Eating Disorders Inventory-2 (EDI-2) and to further
    explore dissatisfaction in the trans participants using the Hamburg
    Body Drawing Scale (HBDS). The results showed that overall
    participants with eating disorders scored higher than trans or
    control groups on all EDI-2 measures, but that trans individuals had
    greater body dissatisfaction than control participants and,
    importantly, trans males had comparable body dissatisfaction scores
    to eating disordered males. Drive for thinness was greater in
    females (cis and trans) compared with males. In relation to HBDS
    body dissatisfaction, both trans males and trans females reported
    greatest dissatisfaction not only for gender-identifying body parts
    but also for body shape and weight. Overall, trans males may be at
    particular risk for eating disordered psychopathology and other body
    image-related behaviours. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

Previous research has established that transgender men and women experience poorer physical and psychological health than cisgender populations (e.g., Connell 2021; Downing and Przedworski 2018; Reisner et al. 2015). Health behaviors that increase the likelihood of ill health are also more prevalent in the transgender community (e.g., Bishop et al. 2020). The prevalence of disordered eating (Romito et al. 2021; Uniacke et al. 2021) and risky body change strategies such as laxative use and self-induced vomiting (Diemer et al. 2015; Guss et al. 2017) have attracted particular attention. Behavior negatively impacting physical or psychological health may, in part, reflect separation from the primary social support network (Pflum et al. 2015) and increased exposure to social stigma, discrimination, and abuse in the transgender community (Bradford et al. 2013; Miller and Grollman 2015; Watson, Veale, and Saewyc 2017).

It is important, therefore, to acknowledge the transphobia and minority stress experienced by the transgender community (Cusack et al. 2021; Gordon et al. 2016) and the extent to which disordered eating or risky body change strategies may serve as a defense mechanism or coping strategy (Coelho et al. 2019). In addition, body dissatisfaction and disordered eating may reflect the discomfort with body shape prior to gender affirmation which characterizes gender dysphoria. Few studies have, however, considered the manner in which body dissatisfaction and associated health behavior vary across stages of the gender affirmation process. The present study was conducted to address this issue.

Case reports have documented the relationship between gender dysphoria, body dissatisfaction, and eating behavior. For example, Surgenor and Fear (1998) report the case of a transgender woman who expressed a belief that her eating disorder symptoms and gender identity were closely connected, and that her desire to obtain and maintain an idealized feminine shape triggered food restriction and purges. In addition, symptom remission was only experienced during a six-month period which involved an attempt to live as a woman. Similarly, Winston et al. (2004) reported on patients referred to an eating disorder service whose weight loss was motivated by a desire to achieve a more feminine shape and who during therapy began to present with symptoms of gender dysphoria. More recent cases involving young transgender women aspiring to achieve thin feminine body shapes and subsequent development of disordered eating have also provided evidence to support earlier reports (Couturier et al. 2015; Ewan, Middleman, and Feldmann 2013).

In contrast to transgender women, it has been argued that transgender men may perceive weight loss to be desirable because it leads to the suppression of secondary sexual characteristics and menstruation (Avila, Golden, and Aye 2019; Couturier et al. 2015). Large scale studies are consistent with these assertions and demonstrate that some members of the transgender community engage in disordered eating because it facilitates suppression of physical features or accentuates characteristics aligned to their gender identity (Ålgars, Santtila, and Sandnabba 2012). For example, disordered eating behavior may be focused on muscularity in transgender men (Kamody et al. 2020). There appears to be increasing evidence, therefore, that transgender men and women are at greater risk of developing disordered eating than cisgender populations and that this risk is likely to be intrinsically linked to their gender role identification, gender-specific ideals, and body image pathology (Jones et al. 2016; Murray, Boon, and Touyz 2013).

The effects of gender affirmation---i.e., the "process whereby a person receives social recognition and support for their gender identity and expression" (Sevelius 2013, 676)---on body image and eating pathology are less clear (Strandjord et al. 2015). However, it would seem likely that body dissatisfaction and disordered eating decline as a person's body and role in society become more closely aligned with their gender identity. Previous research indicates that increased access to medical and legal gender affirmation reduces the risk of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in transgender populations (Gordon, Moore, and Guss 2021; Kamody et al. 2020). Further, it has been argued that surgical treatment helps to reduce body image concerns and psychological distress (Bandini et al. 2013; Khoosal et al. 2009; Winston et al. 2004). Indeed, both hormonal and surgical treatments may be associated with improved psychological wellbeing and quality of life (Agarwal et al. 2018; Motmans et al. 2012; White Hughto, and Reisner 2016).

Other research indicates that eating disorder symptomatology continues post-surgery (Hepp and Milos 2002; Winston et al. 2004). The inconsistency between studies may reflect the complexity of the gender affirmation process. For example, an analysis of interview data (Ålgars et al. 2012) uncovered themes relating to both positive change such as improvements in body image and reduction in disordered eating, and negative change for example, unwanted weight gain from hormone therapy and continued eating pathology. In addition, current understanding has been limited by the tendency for research to consider one aspect or stage of gender affirmation only. It is, of course, important to note that there may be substantial variation in the gender affirmation process. For example, while some transgender men and women may want hormonal therapy and/or surgery, others may not pursue or have access to this medical intervention. Therefore, gender affirmation should not be regarded a linear process or one in which all transgender men and women seek or actually experience all stages.

In recent years, there has been greater consideration of conceptual and theoretical models in relation to body image and disordered eating in the transgender community. For example, Gordon et al. (2016) apply ecosocial theory and a gender affirmation framework to disordered eating among young transgender women, while Gordon, Moore, and Guss (2020) apply a conceptual model of risk and protective pathways to risky body weight and shape control behaviors among transgender and gender diverse populations. In the present study, a critical realist framework was adopted to identify, understand, and report the reality of the participant experience. This framework acknowledges that the world as we understand it has been constructed through our perspectives and experience (Bhaskar 2010) and has been applied to previous health behavior research employing thematic analysis (Bower, Perz, and Conroy 2020). Therefore, we focus on the reality of body image and disordered eating as experienced by transgender men and women rather than a more reductionist approach to documenting the incidence of such behavior. It is important to note that the critical realist framework should be regarded as a philosophical or ontological approach that guides the research approach rather than one that determines the specific factors increasing the likelihood of body dissatisfaction or disordered eating (Gorski 2013).

The experience of body dissatisfaction and eating behavior in transgender men and women requires further investigation, and research recognizing the importance of the stage of gender affirmation may be particularly beneficial. Therefore, the present study investigated the extent to which gender dysphoria influences body dissatisfaction, attitudes to food, and eating behavior at various stages of gender affirmation.

## Method

### ***Participants***

Transgender men and women (*N* = 22) aged 19 to 71 years were recruited. Seventeen participants identified as female, however five were not living "full-time" as women. Of these five, two individuals had only just "come out" as transgender, were "dressing part-time," and self-medicating with female hormones; two were "dressing part-time" and had not "come out" as transgender women; and one individual who lived "part-time" as a woman was receiving hormone therapy and classed herself as a "lapsed transvestite." Four participants were transgender men, all living as men "full-time," but each at different stages of gender affirmation. One volunteer identified with both male and female genders; their interview differed markedly from interviews with other participants and was therefore excluded from final analyses. Participant sexuality included heterosexual, homosexual, pansexual, and asexual orientations. The sample was not ethnically diverse, and all participants identified themselves as "white." Participants were at varying stages of gender affirmation at the time of the study. See Table 1 for full participant information.

### ***Procedure***

Previous research investigating body image and disordered eating in transgender populations has typically compared quantitative responses to standardized questionnaires to cisgender populations, recruited transgender women only, or not fully considered the impact of stage of gender affirmation (e.g., Ewan, Middleman, and Feldmann 2014; Khoosal et al. 2009). Hence, in the present study, each participant completed a private interview which addressed each stage of gender affirmation experienced. Interviews focused on participant's own experiences and as some participants had not experienced later stages of gender affirmation (i.e., hormone therapy and mid- to post-surgery) they were not asked about this aspect of gender affirmation. All interviews were conducted by the second author. Qualitative research is particularly effective when recruiting marginalized or underrepresented populations such as transgender men and women, and for providing opportunities for participants to raise issues not previously considered by the researchers.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted to provide both consistency and flexibility. Interview questions were developed in collaboration with a member of the transgender community following attendance at LGBTQI+ awareness events and completion of online training courses provided by the Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES). Questions were designed to elicit information relating to stressors, health behavior, and physical and mental health. For example, "What did you do in order to cope with these experiences" and "Can you tell me about your current experience living in your true gender identity." Though a topic guide was developed, in a number of instances, the interviewer consciously stepped back from the initial questions to allow participants to tell their stories.

Interviews began by asking participants to discuss their early experiences of gender dysphoria and their responses shaped subsequent questions and prompts. For example, if participants described a specific event that was important to them, they were asked to expand on this (e.g., whether they received support and how they coped with the event). This approach allowed the interviewer to explore core issues specified in the topic guide while providing participants the opportunity to focus on those issues and events that were most important to them in a meaningful way rather than adhering to a stricter question format and order. Participants also completed a brief demographic questionnaire (e.g., sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc.).

Participants were recruited at transgender support group meetings in Northwest England, either via distribution of information sheets by the group coordinator or attendance by the second author. People were eligible to take part if they self-identified as transgender and were at any stage of the gender affirmation process (i.e., intended to begin gender affirmation, were currently in the process of gender affirmation, or had completed their intended gender affirmation). Social support groups provide access to a diverse transgender sample, including older transgender men and women, previously described as "an invisible population" (Shankle et al. 2003, 159). Indeed, relatively few studies have considered transgender experiences in older populations (e.g., Fredriksen-Goldsen et al. 2014). All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Non-verbal behavior such as sighing and laughter were indicated in brackets, grammar was not altered, and participants' idiolects were preserved. Pseudonyms replaced real participant names and any identifying information (e.g., support group name and location) was removed at the time of transcription. All participants provided informed consent and were given the opportunity to review a transcript of their interview.

The analytic strategy was based on Braun and Clarke's (2006) six phases of thematic analysis and therefore involved familiarization with the data, generation of initial codes (completed on a line-by-line basis), searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and producing the report. As the key research question involved a comparison of themes at various stages of gender affirmation, data codes were collated (adopting an inductive approach) with regard to their place within the narrative. Salient themes and subthemes were then identified. Codes and themes were reviewed in a systematic, iterative, and reflexive way (Braun, Clarke, and Terry 2015). Initial codes and themes were identified by the second author, and confirmed with the first and third authors, all of whom are cisgender women.

Calculation of an inter-coder reliability is not consistent with our methodological approach (Braun and Clarke, 2013) and we note that intercoder reliability is "a somewhat controversial topic in the qualitative research community, with some arguing that it is an inappropriate or unnecessary step within the goals of qualitative analysis" (O'Connor and Joffe 2020, 1). Instead, we focus on other measures of research quality intended for use with qualitative data including confirmability and credibility (Leininger 1994). For example, where information revealed by participants during interview was unclear or ambiguous, the researcher sought clarification to check understanding. Further, we have no reason to doubt the credibility of their personal accounts and there was a significant cost to participants providing their time and energy to discuss personal and sensitive issues.

## Results

Findings are organized by stage of gender affirmation: pre-gender affirmation, coming out and early gender affirmation, hormone therapy, and mid- to post-surgery.

### ***Pre-gender affirmation***

All transgender men (*n* = 4) and women (*n* = 18) interviewed reflected on their pre-gender affirmation experiences. Emerging themes were "managing gender," "stress and depression," and "consequence of other coping mechanisms." Each theme appeared to be characterized by an ambivalence towards physical health coupled with a motivation to prioritize psychological wellbeing. Findings suggest transgender men and women are at increased physical risk during this stage of gender affirmation.

#### Managing gender

Relationships between gender identity, body image, and eating behavior were complex. For some participants, eating behavior provided an opportunity to actively change their body shape and size as a response to their gender dysphoria. For example, a larger body could deflect attention from gender and from sexual orientation. In particular, Helen discussed the advantages of a larger body prior to gender affirmation. She stated, "you get jokes about being overweight but jokes about, from your classmates, and things about being overweight are so much less painful about being effeminate, and much less risky from being misunderstood as homosexual." She used her larger body size to cope better with her pre-gender affirmation body, explaining,

> If you're largely overweight you can sort of sculpt your body a bit in private, dress and behave as you really need/want to and in public just be someone who is not going to be assumed to be doing typically male activities. It acts as a very good protection and it's easy to deflect conversations into areas that are not gendered...It becomes very helpful as a sort of part of the disguise of being overweight. Probably not consciously, but subconsciously.

In contrast, though Katerina also associated body fat with femininity, she described reducing her food intake, purging, and excessive exercise. For example, she stated,

> I tried to get rid of as much fat as I could by just doing a lot of running, a lot of weights, but when running I passed out because I wasn't eating properly and I was doing too much gym, quite a few times.

This behavior arose because Katerina felt ashamed of her gender identity and was attempting to demonstrate her masculinity. She explained,

> I was trying to overcompensate for being feminine... I thought that would stop the feelings I had inside, but it didn't it just made them worse. ... I think I was trying to let others know that I was more of a man really, but everyone could see because of the way that I acted that I wasn't, cos I've always very feminine anyway, in my actions and stuff.

Ultimately her behavior can be theorized as an attempt to manage her dual genders---to suppress her female identity, she purged herself and attempted to lose weight, and to enhance her physical appearance, she tried to become more muscular. Similarly, Rosie used body size as part of an attempt to hide her female gender identity. She reported,

> I used to be an eighteen stone bodybuilder because I used to train six days a week, two and a half hours a night, and I had a really big muscular body, again trying to mask the fact of who I actually was.

Of the four transgender men, two described restricting eating to manage gender. For example, Nathan commented "I have quite a big problem with my weight anyway. I don't like it. ... A lot of it was to do with not liking how I looked, so not eating was kind of the way forwards." He also acknowledged practical issues, explaining that "it's really hard to bind when your chest is really big" and restricted eating allowed him to modify "the bits I didn't like." Hence, Nathan's motivation to lose weight was also related to his need to suppress feminine bodily features. Overall, transgender men and women appeared to use weight gain and loss to manage how they felt about their bodies and gender identities, as well as influence how others perceived them. In this sense, weight control formed part of an overall strategy for coping with dysphoric feelings. This theme was also associated with the emergence of disordered eating, indicating that individuals at this stage may be at risk of developing eating disorders.

#### Stress and depression

The incidence of stress and depression was clear and references to depression, anti-depressant medication, self-harm, or suicide were common among participants. As described by Sally,

> it's only two and a half years since I last felt suicidal completely. ... Dysphoria gets you. It's little things, they add up and add up and add up, and then something triggers the whole thing and you just go into a depressive cycle.

Similarly, Tanya commented,

> I got heavily depressed, very depressed in fact. ... They had a counsellor and the counsellor sort of helped, but they also then went bankrupt and I got very depressed---suicidal, you know. I come very close on more than one occasion.

Participants that did not specifically identify a history of depression, anti-depressant medication, or suicidal ideation (*n* = 6) also often discussed their mental health. For example, comparing her current mental health to earlier experiences, Jill stated, "my mental health has changed. There was things going on in my head. Was I mentally ill? Was I not mentally ill?"

These issues often impacted on eating patterns. For example, Darren recalled, "when it's a struggle to get out of bed and it's a struggle to get through the day, the last thing you're going to think about is 'Right well, what do I need nutritionally?'" Similarly, Nathan stated, "I don't really eat. If you see me eating, you know it's a good day. It's like, yesterday I think I lived off a tube of pringles," and ,"My head is all over the place most of the time anyway, but when I'm having a good day I'll eat, when I'm not having a good day I just won't eat." This suggests that although Nathan's motivation to lose weight can be traced to his desire to suppress secondary sexual characteristics, it was his mood which dictated whether he ate and what he ate.

Both transgender men and women talked specifically about weight gain through emotional eating and the use of food as a source of comfort. For example, Darren described, "If I had any money, I would then buy voluminous food such as pasta, any kind of cakes, anything that, you know, that would fill me very quickly. It was almost like a comfort kind of food." His emotional eating could be traced back to traumatic experiences of transphobic bullying at school and subsequent isolation and depression, highlighting how transphobic harassment can trigger a depression which drives a range of health risk behaviors. Chantelle described her binge eating and purging. She related this pattern directly to the person she saw in the mirror. She explained,

> When I look in the mirror and I see me looking back at me that I don't think is me---it's a big fat hairy horrible man looking back at me. That's how I feel---disgusted. That's what it makes me feel. It's horrible. I hate it, cos I look stunning as a woman and that's how I see, when I look out of my eyes, that's how I think... It's like a stranger looking back at you.

Self-loathing stopped Chantelle from caring about the effect of eating on her body. For example, she admitted,

> I'd get really, really depressed, yeah, and I did, I did, what the hell---stuff your face. Do you know what I mean? Stuff your face, comfort eat, and it doesn't matter what I look like cos it's not what I want to be anyway.

Many participants spoke about emotional eating indirectly. For example, Jane described the stress of hiding her transgender identity from her wife as "just like a big knot inside me" and reported that she was overeating in regular binge eating episodes. For example, she described "Chocolate, fries, chips. You know, I'd fry chips at midnight, yeah. Just a---just a chocolateaholic, yeah, and it would be a full box." Similarly, Robert described overeating, stating,

> I was eating about seven or eight packets \[of crisps\] a week and biscuits, maybe two or three packets, and bread---you know extra sandwiches that I shouldn't be eating... \[because\] I was very depressed cos I didn't like what I saw in the mirror. I didn't like the way I felt when I walked."

Overall, these accounts demonstrate that stress and depression arising prior to gender affirmation have the potential to lead to substantial disturbances in eating behavior.

#### Consequences of other coping mechanisms 

The misuse of recreational drugs (*n* = 3) or alcohol (*n* = 5) was also apparent, which impacted eating behavior and body shape and size. For example, Rosie recalled that she lost weight because she often "wouldn't eat for days." However, this was a by-product of a cocaine addiction, which developed while dressing in secret. She explained

> I went through years of buying cocaine, not to go out and have it, but to have it in my bedroom and I--- It was... I could only say, to describe the feeling, it would probably be like having, you know, an injection of female hormones instantly. It---the feeling---was just amazing. I mean, I'd be going out, if I had a line with friends, I'd just wanna stay in and dress up.

Her story demonstrates how the desire to be feminine can be so powerful for some transgender women that it leads to risky health behavior, and again supports the hypothesis that prior to gender affirmation psychological needs often take priority over physical health.

A comparable example can be drawn from Daisy's interview, as she gained substantial weight prior to gender affirmation, though she did not cite emotional eating. Rather, she related this to her alcohol consumption, explaining, "I started just buying lots of alcohol, for the last six months or something like that. I started buying lots of, you know, things like vodka. It'd be bottles and sort of, like, having too much, really." Like Rosie, Daisy's abuse of alcohol was clearly associated with her need to be feminine, as she related her alcohol consumption to

> when I was in the home, I was dressing all the time and it was kind of like, probably longing to be out there, kind of... sort of like it was to, kind of like, numb it or something.

Daisy's weight gain is therefore arguably a by-product of a coping mechanism which involved alcohol.

Conversely, coping mechanisms can also help prevent weight gain. For instance, Josie, Tanya, Lorna, and Sally engaged in non-team, traditionally masculine sports to cope with their dysphoria. For example, Sally stated "I was pretty fit, by that time I was scuba diving, rock climbing, parachuting, so I've been fairly fit all my life." She acknowledged that

> it may have been beneficial in that I suppose in a lot of respects I was overcompensating. So, the sort of higher energy pastimes might've been a compensation for gender dysphoria and so I became fitter rather than the other way around.

Similarly, Lorna commented "They loved me because I was a great athlete... won its league and everything, all the cups for every year right the way through and broke all the records." She added "I thought it would... The more masculine I tried to be, the more I thought that that would go away." These coping mechanisms are not, of course, mutually exclusive. While Tanya and Lorna engaged in a range of sporting activities, they also reported binge drinking and recreational drug use respectively.

### ***Coming Out and Early Gender Affirmation***

Participants described how being discovered or "coming out" as transgender led to vicissitudes in their appearance, lifestyle, and relationships. For example, over half the transgender women interviewed experienced transphobic discrimination or abuse during this period. The themes emerging from this phase were associated with the management of individual and interpersonal changes, both positive and negative. Three themes---"new motivation," "managing gender," and "Stress and Depression"---dominated accounts of this stage. Overall, these themes suggest that this stage of gender affirmation necessitates managing a myriad of personal and social changes, and that this has both positive and negative implications for eating behavior.

#### New motivation

Participants embarking on the gender affirmation process were generally feeling positive about their bodies and were keen to eat a nutritious diet, reach a healthy weight, or maintain it. Rosie (at this stage when interviewed) reported she was "so conscious now of my body and keeping my figure, which is a size eight to ten, which I'm happy with." Chantelle had recently come out as transgender when interviewed and reported she had begun to diet and exercise. She explained,

> I want to look after myself when I'm Chantelle. I've got clothes, I like skinny fit jeans and stuff like that, that I want to get into. I want to look good, but as a man in a pair of baggy jeans and a baggy top, it doesn't matter. I'm not bothered what anybody looks at me and thinks about, because I'm not happy anyway. I don't care.

She further commented, "I've lived thirty-five years as a complete stranger to me. It's my time to shine now," and "I'm bursting now. I want to be out. I want to start living." Her motivation was that "I've got too many nice clothes to fit into---well, Chantelle does anyway---so I want to start getting a nice figure." These comments demonstrate Chantelle's desire to safeguard the wellbeing and appearance of her emergent feminine figure. Weight loss strategies may not always be healthy. For example, although Chantelle spoke of diet, she also admitted to recently "taking T5 fat burners and all this rubbish." This motivation may, of course, extend to other (non-health or eating) aspects of life. For example, Jill described her experience since coming out, "Since I've discovered who I am, what I am, you can't stop me, just totally different."

#### Managing gender

Managing gender was evident in transgender men who seemed motivated to lose weight in order to suppress feminine bodily features. In particular, two of the four transgender men interviewed had attempted weight loss at this stage, with the explicit goal of suppressing feminine bodily features. For example, Darren stated,

> The guys that I know, they all lost weight to try and hide their chest, but then they had, they had the bad posture because they would then walk round hunched everywhere to try and hide it. ... Me and my mates, we all lost weight in order to hide better.

Dale recounted,

> I started using laxatives a lot because I didn't want to put on weight, because, you know, if you put on weight, then, as you know, with the female and male body differences, I will get female fat distribution, so I'll get big on top. And so, I think "I want them gone," so get rid of body fat. So, I was eating very little and I was using laxatives two, three times a day to try and not have any fat on my body at all.

His disordered eating is unsurprising given the distress having breasts had caused him in the past. For example, he recalled

> When I was twelve, I was---I developed sooner than all the other girls at school and I had my first period when I was only ten. So, by the time I was twelve, I was developed up top, which was horrible, horrific time. And then I took a bread knife from the kitchen and tried to cut them off.

These findings suggest that transgender men may be at risk of developing eating disorders early in the gender affirmation process when they are reliant on binding and weight loss to mask their feminine bodily features.

#### Stress and depression

This theme reflected negative aspects of gender affirmation, such as the loss of close relationships and the manner in which distress impacted maladaptive behavior. In particular, participants engaged in emotional eating and selected poor-quality food at this time.

The impact of stress and depression on eating behavior was apparent in Josie's interview. She explained how her gender identity triggered the breakdown of her marriage and bullying at work. She explained,

> I was really, really heavy, because you're comfort eating. You're eating, you're drinking, you're trying to mask pain. You're in pain all the time. The stress of going to work, stress of being laughed at, being joked at, being humiliated, you know all that stuff. Then you have your marriage break down and it's all because of me---it's all because of being transgender. So, if I didn't have all this being transgender, all these things that I'm talking about, wouldn't have happened to me. I'd have sailed along.

Transphobic abuse could also cause stress and weight gain. Tanya described, "I was beat up several times---assaulted with people with baseball bats. An entire street come out at me, attacked me. Even when that happened the police didn't turn up." She continued,

> I moved to my last address because people was uncomfortable with the way I was and were trying to force me out. I've had an arson attack at the house where somebody filled the letterbox with shredded paper, put lighter fuel or something---an accelerant---in and then put matches through the letter box.

She admitted that when she became stressed, she ate:

> I would prob, probably each sommat fairly sweet or high carbs when I got stressed, yeah. Not necessarily bad food, I would just eat food with quite high carbs in. I would eat things like meat pie, cos I was so---I didn't really feel like cooking, so I'd eat things like pies and pasties and maybe go and have fish and chips quite regularly or pizza.

Cassie developed severe depression during her early gender affirmation, she reported:

> I just wanted my life to go away. I wanted to kill myself, but I was just too cowardly. You know, I wished I was dead, but there was no way of doing it, so best thing is just sit there and let myself rot.

Cassie also developed disordered eating, stating, "there was two cases where, like, I did starve myself completely for ten days a time over a six-month period." Her self-destructive behavior can be understood as a reaction to long delays accessing treatment and feeling trapped. For example, she explained that while she was coming out as a transgender woman, she was anxious disclosing to others: "the last thing I wanted to do was tell anyone. ... I was ripped up inside. I couldn't, and the more I couldn't do, the harder it was because I still wasn't there. Nothing was moving." Cassie insisted that she had no previous issues with food or weight, however she admitted that "there was a part of me liked getting thinner."

### ***Receiving hormone therapy***

Seventeen participants reported experience of hormone therapy, either delivered through formal healthcare providers or self-medication (often involving acquisition via internet sources). Two themes emerged for the hormone therapy stage: "increasing awareness and control" and "preparation for surgery." The theme "increasing awareness and control" can be regarded as a continuation of the "new motivation" theme from the previous stage of gender affirmation. Both transgender men and women focused on either losing weight gained during earlier stages of gender affirmation or were anxious about gaining weight as a consequence of the hormone therapy. Participants discussed a variety of weight control strategies. Narratives regarding weight loss in "preparation for surgery" suggest that transgender men and women may be at risk of engaging in disordered eating behavior in a quest to meet criteria for surgery.

#### Increasing awareness and control

Some of those engaging in hormone therapy were concerned about elevated hunger and weight gain resulting from hormone therapy. Hence, participants discussed increased awareness of their appetite, healthy eating, and weight control. For example, Darren, who had been on hormones for an extensive period, described in detail his experience that "hormones change your eating habits massively." He reported that "You have a massive appetite increase er because you need to fuel all the changes that are happening" and that "for the lads you have a massive, massive appetite increase, but it's really, really hard, because if you don't train you get all the aggression and you put on loads of weight." He described the cyclical process of hormone injections, stating,

> I'm every three weeks, so about one and a half weeks I'm at my peak. So, at my peak I've got more energy, so I need to eat a lot of protein. I need to feed it a lot of carbs. And then you start going back down ready for your next injection, but then you start getting sluggish so you just need to eat foods that will give you more and more energy. And you just need... You get used to it because your body will crave certain foods.

Likewise, Hope claimed hormone therapy had a significant impact on her appetite, which she compensated for by periodically missing meals. She stated,

> The biggest problem I've had, I suspect---and I blame this on something else and I shouldn't really---and that is with being on estrogen has really increased my appetite somewhat chronically. I'm famished all the time! I'm hungry all the time and you put some---if my wife ever puts some food in front of me, I eat it, all of it, every bit! And then I'll raid the fridge and whatever. So, weekends are a bad time for me because I'll tend to eat a lot of food and come Tuesday morning, is about the next time I weigh myself when I'm at the hotel, gone to work and whatever. And then that's when I'll miss a meal out and just have a salad for tea. So, I'll have my breakfast, nothing for lunch, and then a bit of a salad for tea and a couple of slices of toast and that's enough to ensure that I lose this weight.

This suggests that some transgender women may attempt to control weight via risky calorie restriction strategies. Those taking herbal hormones were cautious that prescribed hormone therapy would impact body weight. As described by Katerina "hormones might put weight on me as well," suggesting that the side effects of such medication may influence healthcare decisions at this stage of gender affirmation.

Transgender women who did not desire surgery (Josie, Kelly, Hope) were generally motivated to control or lose weight so that they could fit into particular clothes or styles. For example, having had a larger body, Josie stated

> Now I want to reduce dress size. Now I want to get into better dress sizes, you know, and panties---get smaller panties and things. You know, that sort of thing. So, I'm very conscious now, cos I want to get my figure, you know, into proper shape and a proper waist, so I'm looking to lose another stone and get my---get my, you know, a good figure. ... You know, I want to have a slender waist, nice fitting skirts and things, you know. Tight fitting and that, as well.

Overall, comments reveal how the self and body are intertwined, and also how reductions in bodily discomfort and increases in hormone fueled appetite led to increased awareness of eating behavior, body weight, and shape.

#### Preparation for surgery 

Of the seventeen transgender men and women taking hormones, twelve either desired or had undergone surgery. Four of the five participants taking hormones and anticipating surgery discussed the implications of larger body size in relation to gender affirmation surgery. For example, Chantelle considered "the risks of being overweight, and it causes problems with the surgery cos there's too much excess skin when they do the surgery. There's higher risk of it not going to plan." As a consequence, those preparing for surgery typically placed greater emphasis on physical health in preparation for her future surgery. Cassie commented,

> I'm thinking about that a lot now, yeah. Diet and stuff. I'm trying to just eat fish and veg and stuff. I don't eat any other meat other than fish. Exercise. I do a lot of walking and that, but I wanna get more healthy. I just wanna get my metabolism as good as it can be so when I... I can have a good shot at it \[surgery\].

Similarly, Dale discussed his current exercise regime, which was directly linked to his plans for surgery. For example, he stated,

> They do say that the more upper core strength and more muscle you build---chest muscle you build up---then the much more successful the top surgery is when they do the male contouring. They do the double mastectomy, but also the male contouring. ... So, I'm thinking, okay, you know, if I lose the weight and do all the exercising, hit the weights and things and just build up my strength and upper core, then that is preparing for the surgery, so then at least even if I've got a way to go before the surgery, I feel as though I'm still progressing and heading towards something.

The relationship between body weight and preparation for surgery was echoed by transgender women who had undergone surgery. In particular, they reported the challenges presented by body mass index (BMI) targets and employing strict diets beforehand. Tanya stated,

> I'd got the hormone treatment, transitioned, done everything ready for surgery. Got to see the surgeon and he said my BMI was too high and gave a target that was unreachable for me. Literally completely unreachable. It was less than I'd weighed when I was fourteen and I used to do all the sports and stuff like that. So. I mean I'd actually worked it out, I'd have to cut a leg off to reach that BMI, and I was actually seriously considering doing that, and I'm not joking.

Molly described how in order to lose weight for surgery she made substantial changes to her diet. She recalled,

> I was getting towards the end of my counselling I need. I'm getting a bit too much. I need to cut down for my surgery, so I cut out meat and potato pies and went on cuppa soups at lunch times and got my weight down nearly two stone.

The same motivation to lose weight was evident in Sally's interview. She explained,

> I suddenly discovered before I was due to have the operation that maximum measurement around the widest part of your abdomen was thirty-seven inches because obviously a lot of the work is done around the abdomen and mine was forty. I was frightened to death! So, four weeks I had a five hundred calorie a day diet.

She further described a routine of

> five hundred calories a day and a cycle at the local gym. I was down there for two hours a day, as well. I mean, going to the gym doesn't actually lose you much weight at all, but it does tone things up and basically, I was trying to get this down.

Interestingly both Sally and Molly described putting weight back on post-surgery. This is suggestive of the potential for extreme dieting to trigger fluctuations in weight.

### ***Mid- and post-surgery*** 

The recurring theme for the mid- and post-surgery stage of gender affirmation was "contentment versus control." There were fewer interviewees (*n* = 8) from this stage of gender affirmation. All participants reported feeling more positive about their bodies and there appeared to be a reduction in emotional eating. Participants were cognizant of how their bodies and health had changed during gender affirmation and were generally keen to control their weight. Transgender women were more likely to discuss the use of restrained eating, whereas transgender men tended to endorse physical activity and weight training as a form of weight management or body shape control.

#### Contentment versus control 

Participants expressed feelings of wellbeing and increased contentment both in general terms and with their body since engaging with surgery. For example, discussing their general contentment, Tanya asserted, "I'm happy with myself" and Sally commented, "it's infinitely better, there's none of the things associated with gender dysphoria---you know, depression, misery, heartache, arguments." Similarly, Molly stated, "I feel more content. I'm becoming what I want to be, what I should be," and Penny explained, "I do feel a lot more confident in myself, a lot more relaxed and a lot more open. ... Nothing's really changed, just me, just being the person I always thought I was." Illustrating greater contentment with body shape, Helen stated, "it's quite nice seeing the fat distribution being more appropriate to one's internal image of oneself. And yes, so, it's a kind of balance of looking appropriate, feeling appropriate."

At later stages of gender affirmation, transgender women (*n* = 6) described various weight control strategies. For example, Helen stated, "I try not to eat too much. I try to eat more slowly," and Jane commented, "I weigh myself regular so I keep---make sure it's not creeping. ... If I notice the scales are creeping in the wrong way, I live on porridge for a couple of days." Like her counterparts, Sally also stated that she was happier with her body. However, this was juxtaposed with comments that "There are bits obviously that I would prefer not to have. I'd prefer this mummy tummy to disappear completely" and "I would love to lose another stone, but I don't seem to be able to get round to it." As a consequence, she described weight control strategies such as "eating more salads these days and eating---I tend to get things in bulk now and freeze them." In part, Sally's desire to lose further weight may reflect the common association between being feminine and being thin.

The transgender men (*n* = 2) also expressed contentment with their bodies and discussed controlling weight and physical health through diet. Darren who was mid-way through surgeries at the time of the interview, spoke at length about his new approach to food, with eating oriented towards nutritional value. For example, he explained,

> I personally have problems with internal bleeds and things like that. That's one of my things, so I need to then eat a lot of green veg to combat, because you know the properties in the green veg, especially like cabbage and spinach and things like that, the iron and all the other properties do really well for your healing process.

Similarly, Robert approached food from a functional perspective commenting, "my iron's low so I have to eat a lot of vegetables" and "I have to drink a lot of water because I used to suffer---I used to suffer a lot with urinary infection through stress." Both transgender men discussed weight control strategies. For instance, Darren commented,

> I'm on quite a strict diet,---quite a strict training regime. So, I'm working to improve my health and everything that goes with it. Obviously, my physique, as well. I'm working on that slowly. I've set myself---I've got a goal for a year, so in a year's time I want to be a lot slimmer but have bulked---gained muscle.

These commentaries highlight the importance of controlling weight and maintaining health at this stage.

In contrast to the transgender women, whose focus tended to be on calorie restriction, Darren and Robert talked enthusiastically about exercise, weight training, and building muscular physiques. For example, Robert commented, "The most I can do in a week of tummy exercises is 2,500." Darren also explained,

> Obviously, you've spent all your life being female and now all of a sudden you've got all this testosterone and you've got---no matter how much you trained before, your muscle structure is never the same. But now obviously I build muscle. So, my arms---because you get really obsessed about muscle. Like, some guys don't, but more often than not we get really obsessed with body shape and muscle.

Participant commentaries on food and weight during this stage of gender affirmation provide evidence of a balancing of contentment with awareness of a need to control or lose weight. This does not necessarily mean all participants were successful in achieving this, however attitudes at this stage contrast starkly with pre-gender affirmation and reveal a shift in priorities which favors the safeguarding of physical health.

## Discussion

In the present study, the body dissatisfaction and disordered eating reported by transgender men and women were closely related to the pressures experienced at each stage of gender affirmation. Findings highlight the need to consider the importance of stage of gender affirmation when investigating the interplay between gender dysphoria, body dissatisfaction, and eating behavior (McGuire et al. 2016; Staples et al. 2020) and have important implications for transgender health research and practice.

At the pre-gender affirmation stage, three themes emerged: "managing gender," "stress and depression," and the "consequence of other coping mechanisms." In terms of managing gender, disordered eating was used by transgender men and women to manage self-perceptions and emotions in relation to their body and gender identity (e.g., to create or mask female anatomical features) and to influence the perceptions of others. This is consistent with previous research documenting the use of food restriction or compensatory eating behavior to prevent puberty onset or progression (Coelho et al. 2019). Disordered eating in order to achieve these goals could increase health risks for transgender men and women. Health professionals should be aware of these issues and ensure that appropriate support is provided at the pre-gender affirmation stage.

Similarly, negative affect (stress and depression), arising as a consequence of bullying/harassment, hiding one's transgender identity, or hatred towards their body was linked to food consumption (either under-eating or emotional overeating), the consumption of nutrient deficient foods, and bulimic strategies. Indeed, the emotional aspects of eating behavior and relationships between mental health and eating behavior are well-established (Aoun et al. 2019). Maladaptive behaviors, adopted in order to cope with gender dysphoria (i.e., cocaine use, alcohol abuse, and exercise addiction), also influenced food selection and intake. Findings highlight the importance of contextualizing high-risk eating behavior in transgender populations (Sevelius 2013) and of supporting those experiencing distress during the pre-gender affirmation stage to develop adaptive coping strategies. Findings also contribute to evidence demonstrating the consequences of delays to gender affirmation treatment and the extent to which a lack of support can impact the health of transgender men and women (Carlile, Butteriss, and Sansfacon 2021; Ellis, Bailey, and McNeil 2015).

The coming out and early gender affirmation stage saw the re-emergence of two of the pre-gender affirmation stage themes: "managing gender" and "Stress and depression." In terms of the former, here again the primary motivation (for transgender men) was food restriction leading to weight-loss in order to conceal breast tissue or self-harming behavior (i.e., attempting to remove them altogether). Stress and depression at this stage for transgender women was linked again with transphobic abuse, but also with having to cope with problematic interpersonal relationships (i.e., loss or conflict with spouses, family, and friends) or frustration associated with the speed of access to treatment, leading to either a starvation feeding regimen or emotional overeating. Findings are consistent with previous research documenting the relationship between stressful life events and health behavior in the transgender community (Miller and Grollman 2015; Peltzer and Pengpid 2016) and highlight the importance of developing adaptive coping strategies and accessing appropriate support.

The coming out and early gender affirmation stage also revealed the emergence of a new theme: "new motivation." Transgender women expressed the wish to eat healthily and control portion sizes for two main reasons: to lose weight or maintain a low body weight in order to create and display a more feminine figure or to reduce risk in the light of anticipated surgery. However, risky weight loss strategies were evident (e.g., self-medication with weight-loss pills). Researchers must examine the relationships between femininity, body weight, self-identity, and societal acceptance further, for example, the extent to which transgender women in Western societies believe that a low body weight is part of the "ideal" feminine body shape that must be reached in order to feel or be treated as attractive and feminine. Practitioners supporting transgender men and women during the coming out and early gender affirmation stage should be aware of the potential for both positive and negative associations with eating to develop in this phase.

For transgender men and women at the receiving hormone therapy stage, there was an increase in awareness and control of appetite, weight, and body shape. Consistent with the previous stage, there remained a "new motivation" to lose weight or maintain a low weight. However, hormone therapy was reported to be linked to a large increase in appetite, with the potential for weight-gain. As reported elsewhere (Ålgars, Santtila, and Sandnabba 2010), this creates anxiety in relation to the desired body shape and in relation to meeting weight criteria for surgery. This was sometimes dealt with by employing risky calorie restriction and exercise strategies in order to achieve the required pre-surgery weight. Findings are consistent with literature on the emergence of risky dieting behavior in transgender populations (Diemer et al. 2015; Witcomb et al. 2009) and contribute to existing research (e.g., Fisher et al. 2014) examining the impact of hormone therapy on transgender body image.

Greater acknowledgement and discussion of this issue is required, especially as the body mass requirements for gender affirmation surgery vary, data relating body mass and surgical outcomes are lacking, and body mass requirements for surgery may negatively impact patient health and wellbeing (Brownstone et al. 2021). The relationship between body weight, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating should, of course, be considered in the context of weight related stigma (both from health practitioners and the general population) and the impact of this stigma on health and wellbeing (e.g., Major, Eliezer, and Rieck 2012; Puhl and Brownell 2006). For example, weight related stigma may increase unwanted attention that is especially problematic when experiencing gender dysphoria and in the context of discrimination and abuse targeted at the transgender community (Bradford et al. 2013).

At the final stage, mid- and post-surgery, the theme that emerged most strongly was "contentment versus control," and a shift in priorities from a motivation to focus on psychological wellbeing to a focus on physical health. For some, contentment in relation to body image emerged, along with a reduction in emotional overeating. Transgender women expressed an increased feeling of wellbeing and greater satisfaction with body image. However, there was also a desire to be thinner, possibly because transgender women associate being thin with being feminine (Gordon et al. 2016). This stage was therefore also characterized by stringent weight control strategies for some people and further research exploring relationships between feminine body ideals, body dissatisfaction, and weight control in transgender women is required.

Similarly, transgender men expressed a greater contentment with their body image and used food in relation to physical health (e.g., consuming vegetables to promote healing after surgery or drinking lots of water to treat urinary infections). Though weight control was still a major concern, this time a stringent diet and exercise routine were combined to achieve the desired slender-but-muscular physique. This is consistent with recent research suggesting that transgender men become more motivated to care for their body as they progress through stages of gender affirmation (Linsenmeyer et al. 2021) and suggests that measures should be introduced to address existing delays to the gender affirmation process. Transgender men and women have important nutritional requirements that change across the gender affirmation process. There has, however, been little recognition of this issue or formal guidance for transgender men and women. Indeed, previous research has documented the use of social media to obtain transgender relevant nutrition information (Schier and Linsenmeyer 2019). Additional research and guidance are required to support the nutritional needs of transgender men and women at each stage of the gender affirmation process (Rozga et al. 2020).

Findings demonstrate the importance of considering the extent to which gender dysphoria influences body dissatisfaction, attitudes to food, and eating behavior at various stages of gender affirmation. Clearly, each stage of gender affirmation presents specific issues that must be understood and accommodated by health professionals. Further, it is important to recognize important barriers to effective healthcare. For example, weight has become a core issue for those addressing the health of transgender men and women and weight-based stigma can impede health provision, with a tendency for healthcare providers to attribute health issues to body weight (Paine 2021). Interventions intended to improve patient healthcare should ensure that they do not increase existing health inequalities by encouraging weight-based stigma, which reduces engagement with healthcare services and exacerbates the discrimination already experienced by the transgender community (Paine 2018).

### ***Limitations and future research***

Findings are, of course, limited by reliance on a relatively small sample, precluding the extrapolation of findings to the transgender community at large. In particular, all participants identified as white, and these findings cannot inform our understanding of the intersections of racism and transphobia in this context (e.g., Ghabrial 2017; Sevelius 2013). Further, it is important to acknowledge that gendered standards of beauty are racialized, such as through privileging thinness and non-Black hair types (Bryant 2019; Kelch-Oliver and Ancis 2011). These racialized standards may negatively impact the body image and eating behavior of non-white transgender women, especially where gender affirmation focuses on racialized aesthetic ideals (Gonsalves 2020). Additional research in this area is required. Similarly, future research should consider cultural variation in the gender affirmation process, including the influence of societal acceptance of transgender men and women and social support (Elischberger et al. 2018). Indeed, research indicates that there is considerable cross-cultural variation in transgender experiences (Reisner, Keatley, and Baral 2016).

Future research should ideally be prospective in nature, so that individual differences and changes in emotions, thoughts, and health behavior can be captured throughout the gender affirmation process, together with those factors exacerbating or lessening body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. These studies may elucidate the nature and timely implementation of interventions to offset the mental distress, negative body image, and maladaptive coping behavior reported here. Research investigating the effectiveness of treatment delivered to transgender clients with body image or eating disorders is particularly important as previous research indicates that these services and wider mental health services are often inadequate (Duffy, Henkel, and Earnshaw 2016; McCann and Sharek 2016).

To conclude, the present study highlights the need to consider the influence of stage of gender affirmation when researching the interconnections between attitudes, behavior, and emotions relating to gender identity. For both transgender men and women, a shift was evident from a focus on psychological wellbeing in the early stages of gender affirmation to physical wellbeing in the later stages. While body dissatisfaction seems to dissipate as the gender affirmation progresses, a common theme at each stage was that both transgender men and women engaged in risky and often maladaptive behavior related to transforming body shape and size (although motivations changed across the gender affirmation process). It is, therefore, essential that transgender men and women are provided with support in these areas throughout the gender affirmation process.
