Participants with a conflicted gender identity were compared to controls matched on age and biological sex. Participants with a conflicted gender identity showed higher levels of body dissatisfaction, women with a conflicted gender identity also showed more eating disturbance than controls. Among men with a conflicted gender identity, male–male sexual experience was associated with more body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Among women with a conflicted gender identity, female–female sexual experience was related to less body dissatisfaction. Possible explanations for these findings and the potential clinical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Understanding behavioral issues associated with eating would provide important insight into obesity development and possibly procure ways to prevent its occurrence or to treat it. This study's objectives were to examine links between cognitive, behavioral, and emotional aspects of eating habits and chronotype, impulsivity, anxiety, and depression among university students.Subjects and methods: The following questionnaires were used: TFEQ-R 18, UPPS-short, HADS, and MEQ. All participants gave their informed written consent prior to enrolment.Results: Among females, increased BMI was associated to uncontrolled eating and emotional eating, while in males, BMI was associated to emotional eating only. In males, no associations of BMI with impulsivity were found while in females they were present. Chronotype scores were positively correlated to cognitive restraint and negatively to uncontrolled eating among males. No associations were found for females. CR was lower among females with higher depression scores, while higher anxiety scores were associated to UE among males.Conclusions: This was a cross-sectional study of three cognitive and emotional domains related to eating habits among university students (young adults). Results showed significant correlations between BMI, TFEQ-R18 scores, impulsivity and anxiety or depression. Future studies should replicate findings in samples of individuals with different aspects of eating disorders such as binge eating disorder, food addiction or bulimia nervosa.},

	abstract = {Substance use is prevalent amongst Australians who have experienced homelessness, but the social impacts of using substances amongst this group are poorly understood. This study uses a relational and critical realist approach to understand the role of substance use on the social lives of people with lived experience of homelessness. A mixed-methods design was used to explore this question and assess the experiences of people who have exited homelessness. Recruiting across services catering to marginalised populations, 110 participants completed a cross-sectional survey. Findings showed substance use both socially connected and disconnected participants, and that attempting abstinence required participants to negotiate and alter their social networks. To participants, being a substance “user,” or “non-user,” was a social identity that they actively negotiated to facilitate competing social, psychological and material/embodied needs. Participants chose to engage and not engage with others to craft a social identity they valued, which had the sometimes-negative side-effect of limiting potential relationships, leaving users feeling isolated from their non-users and a continued imperative to keep using. The impacts of substance use on social networks were similar for currently and formerly homeless participants, suggesting transitioning into housing may not immediately prompt a reduction in substance use or influence from substance-using peers. Interventions with substance users with lived experience of homelessness would benefit from taking a social identity approach that incorporates an understanding of the material/embodied aspects of addiction to provide a holistic model of care that best supports the relational needs of the client.},

	abstract = {Objectives. We examined relationships between social determinants of health and experiences of transgender-related discrimination reported by transgender people in Virginia.

Methods. In 2005 through 2006, 387 self-identified transgender people completed a statewide health needs assessment; 350 who completed eligibility questions were included in this examination of factors associated with experiences of discrimination in health care, employment, or housing. We fit multivariate logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations to adjust for survey modality (online vs paper).

Results. Of participants, 41\% (n = 143) reported experiences of transgender-related discrimination. Factors associated with transgender-related discrimination were geographic context, gender (female-to male spectrum vs male-to-female spectrum), low socioeconomic status, being a racial/ethnic minority, not having health insurance, gender transition indicators (younger age at first transgender awareness), health care needed but unable to be obtained (hormone therapy and mental health services), history of violence (sexual and physical), substance use health behaviors (tobacco and alcohol), and interpersonal factors (family support and community connectedness).

Conclusions. Findings suggest that transgender Virginians experience widespread discrimination in health care, employment, and housing. Multilevel interventions are needed for transgender populations, including legal protections and training for health care providers.},

Concurrently, they are subject to constant discussion in the UK national media and politics, where many negative assumptions are made about their needs, experiences and clinical provision. Their journey to seek appropriate care has not yet been documented.Aims We trace the experiences of trans and non-binary children and youth and their families in their decision to seek, searches for and experiences with affirmative and non-affirmative clinical input for help with their gender.Method 27 dyadic, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with trans and non-binary children and young people and their parents from 13 families.Results The process of seeking support via National Health Service clinical routes in England, UK is beset with lengthy waiting lists, issues with geographical inaccessibility, a lack of relevant clinical knowledge, and a failure to recognize the value of family expertise. Family doctors provide contraceptive hormones in lieu of proper access to puberty blocking or gender affirming hormones, and most families resort to private care they can ill afford.Discussion Training in gender identity and gender dysphoria is recommended for both family doctors, and children’s mental health services. Gender identity development services could be decentralized, with local hubs offering more accessible support.},

	abstract = {Ruminative thought patterns, defined as repetitive negative self-focused attention, are considered an avoidant coping strategy for managing stress. As trans and nonbinary (TNB) individuals commonly experience prejudice and discrimination in response to their gender identities (i.e. minority stressors), rumination over these stressors may contribute to heightened risk of psychopathology in these groups. Although rumination is a general risk factor for eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, no studies to date have examined whether eating- or gender-related ruminative patterns relate to maintenance of ED psychopathology for TNB individuals. This cross-sectional study investigated whether levels of rumination (both gender-related and ED-specific) mediated the relationship between minority stress and ED psychopathology.
Method
Participants were 242 TNB adults (Mage = 24.92, SD = 6.5, Range = 18-70) recruited online, who completed measures of minority stress, gender-related rumination, ED-specific rumination, and ED psychopathology. We used Preacher-Hayes' approach to examine the parallel mediation model, with gender-related and ED-specific rumination as potential mediators.
Results
Gender-related rumination did not mediate the relation between gender minority stress and ED psychopathology, Indirect B = -0.00 [95\% BCa CI: -0.01, 0.00]; however, ED-specific rumination was significant, indicating partial mediation, Indirect B = 0.01 [95\% BCa CI: 0.00, 0.02].
Conclusion
As gender minority stress and ED-specific rumination relate to ED psychopathology, it is essential that clinicians adopt an intersectional minority stress framework in understanding ED psychopathology among TNB individuals.},

	abstract = {Using an internet-based survey, we examined attitudes toward transgender youth in the United States and India, two cultures with differences in conceptualizations of gender and treatment of transgender individuals in society, law, and religion. We found generally positive attitudes toward transgender youth in our U.S. (n = 218), but moderately negative ones in our Indian (n = 217), sample. Consistent with the literature on prejudice against transgender adults in many Western societies, general social conservatism in the form of religious beliefs and political ideology, gender-specific conservatism in the form of gender binary belief, and endorsement of environmental rather than biological causes of transgender identity were the best predictors of U.S. participants’ attitudes, although personal contact with gender and sexual minorities also played a role at the bivariate level. These findings suggest that the processes underlying prejudice against transgender youth are similar to those that foster adult-directed transphobia in that cultural context. In contrast, religion-based disapproval and environmental causal attributions were the best predictors of Indian respondents’ attitudes, whereas gender binary belief played only a minor role, and political conservatism and personal contact no role at all. Our regression analyses accounted for considerably more of the variability in U.S. than in Indian participants’ attitudes, highlighting the need for additional (qualitative) work to identify the factors that promote transprejudice in India. We discuss these findings in light of cross-cultural differences between the two countries in terms of our predictors and consider implications for efforts to reduce prejudice against transgender youth.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study is one of the first to examine the physical and mental health of transgender older adults and to identify modifiable factors that account for health risks in this underserved population. Design and Methods: Utilizing data from a cross-sectional survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults aged 50 and older (N = 2,560), we assessed direct and indirect effects of gender identity on 4 health outcomes (physical health, disability, depressive symptomatology, and perceived stress) based on a resilience conceptual framework. Results: Transgender older adults were at significantly higher risk of poor physical health, disability, depressive symptomatology, and perceived stress compared with nontransgender participants. We found significant indirect effects of gender identity on the health outcomes via fear of accessing health services, lack of physical activity, internalized stigma, victimization, and lack of social support; other mediators included obesity for physical health and disability, identity concealment for perceived stress, and community belonging for depressive symptomatology and perceived stress. Further analyses revealed that risk factors (victimization and stigma) explained the highest proportion of the total effect of gender identity on health outcomes. Implications: The study identifies important modifiable factors (stigma, victimization, health-related behaviors, and social support) associated with health among transgender older adults. Reducing stigma and victimization and including gender identity in nondiscrimination and hate crime statutes are important steps to reduce health risks. Attention to bolstering individual and community-level social support must be considered when developing tailored interventions to address transgender older adults’ distinct health and aging needs.},

The sexed body itself has also undergone a transformation: Sex no longer resides solely in genitalia but has traveled to more visible parts of the body, implicating racialized aesthetic ideals in its new formulation. The re-imagining of gender identity as genetically and neurologically inscribed and the expanding locus of sex correspond to an inversion of the relationship between gender identity and the sexed body as well as shifts in medical jurisdiction. Whereas psychiatrists in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s understood gender as stemming from genital sex, the less popular idea that gender identity precedes the sexed body has gained traction in recent decades. If gender identity once derived from the sexed body, the sexed body must now be brought into alignment with gender identity. The increasing legitimacy of self-defined gender identity, the expanding definition of racialized sex, and the inversion of the sex–gender identity relationship elevates the role of surgeons in producing racialized and sexed bodies.},

The present study explored weight and shape control behaviors among low-income, ethnically diverse young transgender women at high risk for HIV or living with HIV in a Northeastern metropolitan area. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 participants (ages 18–31 years; mean annual income {\textless}\$10,000; ethnic identity: Multiracial [n = 8], Black [n = 4], Latina [n = 4], White [n = 4], Asian [n = 1]). Interviews were transcribed and double-coded using a template organizing method, guided by ecosocial theory and a gender affirmation framework. Of 21 participants, 16 reported engaging in past-year disordered eating or weight and shape control behaviors, including binge eating, fasting, vomiting, and laxative use. Study participants described using a variety of strategies to address body image concerns in the context of gender-related and other discriminatory experiences, which shaped participants’ access to social and material resources as well as stress and coping behaviors. Disordered weight and shape control behaviors were discussed in relation to four emergent themes: (1) gender socialization and the development of femininity ideals, (2) experiences of stigma and discrimination, (3) biological processes, and (4) multi-level sources of strength and resilience. This formative study provides insight into disordered eating and weight and shape control behaviors among at-risk transgender women, illuminating avenues for future research, treatment, and public health intervention.},

Further underscoring this need, there is mounting evidence that T/GNB populations are at 2–4 times greater risk of experiencing eating disorder symptoms compared to their cisgender (i.e., non-transgender) counterparts. Although research on the risk and protective factors underlying these health inequities is growing, more epidemiologic and clinical research is urgently needed. This chapter synthesizes the current state of the science and provides recommendations for clinicians at all levels of familiarity with T/GNB populations, including clinicians who are just beginning to think about gender diversity in their practice as well as those who have expertise in this area and wish to identify next steps for their clinical care, research, and/or advocacy in the field.},

	abstract = {Substance use disorders are a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. National data comparing the prevalence of substance use disorder diagnoses (SUDDs) among transgender and cisgender individuals are lacking in the United States.To investigate the prevalence of SUDDs among transgender and cisgender adults and to identify within-group and between-group differences by age, gender, and geographic location.This cross-sectional study used the OptumLabs Data Warehouse to analyze deidentified claims from approximately 74 million adults aged 18 years or older enrolled in commercial or Medicare Advantage insurance plans in 2017. A total of 15 637 transgender adults were identified based on a previously developed algorithm using a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) transgender-related diagnosis and procedure codes and sex-discordant hormone prescriptions. A cohort of 46 911 cisgender adults was matched to the transgender cohort in a 3:1 ratio based on age and geographic location.SUDDs, based on ICD-10 codes, were assessed overall and compared between transgender and cisgender cohorts and by geographic region (ie, Northeast, Midwest, South, and West); age groups (eg, 18-25, 26-30, 31-35 years), and gender (ie, transfeminine [TF; assigned male sex at birth, identify along feminine gender spectrum], transmasculine [TM; assigned female sex at birth, identify along masculine gender spectrum], male, and female).In this study of 15 637 transgender adults (4955 [31.7\%] TM) and 46 911 cisgender adults (23 664 [50.4\%] female), most (8627 transgender adults [55.2\%]; 25 882 cisgender adults [55.2\%]) were aged between 18 and 40 years, and 6482 transgender adults (41.5\%) and 19 446 cisgender adults (41.5\%) lived in the South. Comparing transgender to cisgender groups, significant differences were found in the prevalence of a nicotine (2594 [16.6\%] vs 2551 [5.4\%]; P \&lt; .001), alcohol (401 [2.6\%] vs 438 [0.9\%]; P \&lt; .001), and drug (678 [4.3\%] vs 549 [1.2\%]; P \&lt; .001) SUDDs. Among transgender adults, cannabis was the most prevalent drug SUDD (321 [2.1\%]), followed by opioid SUDD (205 [1.3\%]) and cocaine SUDD (81 [0.5\%]), whereas among cisgender adults, cannabis and opioid SUDDs were equally prevalent (cannabis, 186 [0.4\%]; opioid, 207 [0.4\%]), followed by cocaine SUDD (59 [0.1\%]).In this study, the prevalence of SUDDs was significantly elevated among transgender adults relative to their cisgender peers. These findings underscore the need for culturally tailored clinical interventions to treat substance use disorder in transgender populations.},

This paper explores the school experiences of Australian transgender and gender diverse students', with particular consideration of recognition of their gender identity in documentation, experiences of puberty and sexuality education, treatment by staff and students, and other forms of provision. It reports on the findings of a 2013 study which combined a survey of 189 transgender and gender diverse Australian students aged 14–25 years, with 16 online interviews with members of this group. The study was informed by a community advisory group which included a range of transgender, gender diverse and intersex people. Findings include both quantitative and qualitative data, detailing a trend towards more disruptive, fluid and inconsistent identifications by members of this student group, and a diversification of their needs at school. Student advocacy on topics including sexuality and puberty education was shown to be common and also useful in improving individual well-being and social outcomes. We offer some reflections towards more useful school practices and future research.},

Instead, they report significantly lower levels of drive for thinness and bulimia when compared to biological males and females on the same questionnaire. Concerns about their body dissatisfaction were reduced very significantly after surgery as might have been expected. We also found significant levels of perfectionism, identified as excessive personal expectations for superior achievement on the Eating Disorders Inventory, in people with gender identity disorder when compared to the general population as well as to people with eating disorders. As far as we are aware, this is the first study to report such a finding. Some reasons for this are considered in this paper.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of transgender men related to nutrition, exercise, and body image throughout their transition. Our objectives were to 1) describe changes in attitudes and awareness related to nutrition, exercise, and body image throughout the process of transitioning, 2) explore the persistence of feminine or masculine schemas related to these variables, and 3) capture the role of nutrition and exercise as physical embodiments of gender expression.We utilized narrative inquiry and a hybrid biographical, psychological and linguistic approach. The primary investigator conducted semi-structured interviews with ten adult transgender men. Each interview was crafted into a brief narrative and major themes were constructed across the narratives. Strategies of trustworthiness included member checking of the narratives and preliminary results, triangulation of multiple theories, reliance on four research team members in data analysis, and use of verbatim quotes.Five themes were constructed: Coming to life as a man; caring for a new body; expected and actual changes with hormone therapy; health information seeking; balancing the demands of daily life. Each theme was supported by three to five subthemes. A sample of the ten narratives reads: “CM is a 33 year-old transgender male and has been on hormone therapy for over five years. He gained about 60 pounds after starting hormone therapy due to an increase in appetite and a genuine desire to have a larger body size. He describes, “I'm not going to blow over and am just more rugged, solid, stocky” and going from “invisible to visible.” CM is now motivated to care for his health and longevity. He explains, “I really like my life now. It feels great! I get to be a husband. I get to do these things. I get to live my life as I am.”Transgender men's relationship with nutrition and exercise generally improved throughout their transition second to improved body congruence and increased motivated to care for a new body. Healthcare providers can work with their transgender patients to better understand their goals for transitioning related to body size and shape, and can communicate how nutrition and exercise may play a role.This project was funded through an intramural grant at Saint Louis University.},

Within these categories, participants focused on body issues related to gender characteristics and body size. Findings revealed evidence of self-criticism and social distress related to body image dissatisfaction and self-acceptance and social acceptance related to body image satisfaction. Data demonstrated how gender, body size, and the intersection of gender and body size influenced personal perceptions of body dissatisfaction and satisfaction. Developmental processes were evident: participants further along in consolidating a gender identity described gaining a sense of social awareness, self-acceptance, and body satisfaction reflecting a sense of resilience.},

However, little is known about whether gender nonconformity, as a visible marker of one's stigmatized status as a transgender individual, heightens trans people's experiences with discrimination and, in turn, their health. Using data from the largest survey of transgender adults in the United States, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 4,115), we examine the associations among gender nonconformity, transphobic discrimination, and health-harming behaviors (i.e., attempted suicide, drug/alcohol abuse, and smoking). The results suggest that gender nonconforming trans people face more discrimination and, in turn, are more likely to engage in health-harming behaviors than trans people who are gender conforming. Our findings highlight the important role of gender nonconformity in the social experiences and well-being of transgender people.},

Yet ICR assessment can yield numerous benefits for qualitative studies, which include improving the systematicity, communicability, and transparency of the coding process; promoting reflexivity and dialogue within research teams; and helping convince diverse audiences of the trustworthiness of the analysis. Few guidelines exist to help researchers negotiate the assessment of ICR in qualitative analysis.

	abstract = {Among LGBTQ people, those who are gender nonconforming (GNC) may be at heightened risk of both discrimination and underutilization of healthcare—yet little is known about what happens during healthcare encounters to compel GNC individuals to continue or avoid seeking future care. This study qualitatively examines the healthcare experiences of a racially diverse sample of 34 adult LGBTQ cis women, transgender men, and nonbinary individuals in a metropolitan area of the United States who do not conform to dominant biomedical schemas of sex and gender. GNC individuals experience embodied disruption in medical settings when patients are mis/recognized; providers respond to disruption in ways that further distress patients. Broadly, participants report similar experiences across racial and gender identities, but patients manage disruption somewhat differently depending on their embodied positions to gender norms. This study contributes to literature of stress, stigma, and sex, gender, and sexuality within medicine by illuminating how stigmatizing healthcare interactions deter LGBTQ individuals from seeking healthcare. Findings point to the importance of considering both structural factors and embodied visibility in future research addressing how stigma and discrimination manifest within health settings to disadvantage LGBTQ groups.},

Sociomedical stigma related to both fat and sexuality, however, complicates patient-provider perceptions and discussions about weight and health. I analyzed data from interviews with LGBTQ patients, healthcare employees, and observations at a LGBTQ healthcare organization to reveal how weight bias becomes a barrier to care for LBQ cisgender women, transgender men, and nonbinary people assigned female. Understood by patients as similar to “trans broken arm syndrome,"—wherein providers attribute health concerns of trans people to minority gender identities and gender affirming care—patients report “fat broken arm syndrome,” wherein providers are perceived to attribute patient health concerns to weight. Patients interpret weight bias as intersectional stigma—related to multiple marginalized identities and embodiments—that puts their health at risk. Healthcare professionals make sense of risk, however, through competing fat frames. Although patient narratives suggest the promise of utilizing stigma-reduction approaches, many providers—typically those who do not share patient standpoints—emphasize the importance of framing fat as an urgent health risk in order to “do no harm.” This case advances knowledge by demonstrating the relational process through which interventions designed to ameliorate health disparities may inadvertently discourage marginalized, “at-risk” patients from healthcare access and adherence.},

In a cross-sectional survey randomly selected 3262 undergraduate university students (Mean age=20.5 years, SD=1.6) responded to a questionnaire including health indicators, gender identity and sexual orientation. Five percent (153/3262) of eligible participants considered themselves as LGBT youths; 23.5\% of them were severely depressed, 31.4\% had PTSD symptoms, 40\% had suicidal ideation, 35.3\% had made a suicide attempt, 28.6\% were hazardous or harmful alcohol users, 14.0\% had used illicit drugs in the past 12 months, and 46.4\% engaged in pathological internet use. LGBT identity predicted severe depression (AOR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.9, 4.3), suicide attempt (AOR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.1, 2.9), hazardous or harmful alcohol use (AOR 1.7, 95\% 1.1, 2.5), illicit drug use (AOR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.4, 4.0), and pathological internet use (AOR 1.5, 95\% CI 1.1, 2.1), adjusting for age, sex, study year, martial status, religion, subjective economic status, social support, and country. The study confirmed sexual and gender mental health disparity. LGBT university students should be prioritized for mental health and addictive behaviour prevention and intervention.},

	abstract = {For those identifying as transgender or gender nonconforming (TGNC), the support of others can be instrumental in mitigating the challenges associated with cross-gender transition and identification. Social support and connectedness to the TGNC community can positively impact psychological well-being, facilitate resilience, and buffer against external stigmatization, prejudice, and discrimination (Frost \& Meyer, 2012; Hendricks \& Testa, 2012). The present study seeks to improve understanding of relationships among general social support (GSS), trans community connectedness (TCC), depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. The inclusion of 2 forms of social support allows for greater examination of the differential impact of perceived general support (i.e., from both cisgender and TGNC friends and family members) and TGNC-specific social support (i.e., feeling connected to other TGNC people). To honor the diversity within the TGNC community, the impact of social support was examined among TGNC participants differentiated by gender identity, ethnicity, and living environment. As part of the Internet-based Trans Health Survey, standardized measures of depression, generalized anxiety, and social support were administered to 865 TGNC adults. For both trans male spectrum (TMS) and trans female spectrum (TFS) participants, general social support was significantly negatively associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the negative correlation between trans community connectedness and mental health symptoms was significant only for TFS participants. Variations in perceived TCC among ethnicity and living environment groups—distinguished by gender identity—are also explored. Finally, targets for future minority stress and social support research with the TGNC population are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined experiences of weight stigmatization, sources of stigma, coping strategies, psychological functioning, and eating behaviors in a sample of 2671 overweight and obese adults.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The total sample was partitioned into two subsamples for investigation. Sample I was comprised of 2449 adult women, and Sample II was a matched sample of adult men and women (N = 222) that was disaggregated to investigate gender differences. Both samples completed an online battery of self-report questionnaires measuring frequency of weight stigmatization and coping responses to deal with bias, the most common sources of the bias, symptoms of depression, self-esteem, attitudes about weight and obesity, and binge eating behaviors.
RESULTS: Experiences of weight stigmatization, in many forms and across multiple occasions, was common in both samples. A variety of coping strategies were used in response. More frequent exposure to stigma was related to more attempts to cope and higher BMI. Physicians and family members were the most frequent sources of weight bias reported. No gender differences were observed in types or frequency of stigmatization. Frequency of stigmatization was not related to current psychological functioning, although coping responses were associated with emotional well-being.
DISCUSSION: These findings raise questions about the relationship between stigma and psychological functioning and have important implications for obesity treatment and stigma reduction intervention efforts, both of which are discussed.},

Additionally, TGAs experience unique body- and gender-related concerns. The purpose of this study is to explore the nuances of gender identity, gender transitioning, body image, and disordered eating among TGAs. Case summaries and a synthesis of key themes are presented from interviews with nine TGAs aged 16–20 (Mage = 17). All participants reported engaging in at least one behavior to change their weight or shape. Consistent with a theoretical biopsychosociocultural model we proposed, TGAs described body dissatisfaction and disordered eating related to transgender-specific factors (e.g., behaviors aimed at minimizing secondary sex characteristics) and broader developmental and sociocultural factors. Some participants reported improvements in body image and disordered eating following gender transition. The interviews highlight complex associations among gender identity, gender transitioning, body image, and disordered eating during adolescence, suggesting that disentangling transgender-specific factors from other individual factors is difficult. These findings may guide future research on the prevalence and functions of disordered eating among TGAs and point to a unique set of needs for effective detection and treatment of concurrent gender incongruence, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Nutrition care guidelines for the transgender population do not exist, despite significant nutrition-related clinical and psychosocial considerations. Social networking sites (SNSs) provide multidirectional communication and have expanded in popularity among transgender users as a resource for health information and support. The nature of the content shared among the online transgender community is unknown, but may suggest the nutrition-related areas that are of most importance to the transgender population. The objective of this qualitative netnography was to describe the food and nutrition messages shared among the transgender community using video blogs (vlogs) on the SNS, YouTube.

Methods: Public vlogs were assessed using the constant comparative method. Pseudoquantitative methods were used to capture the prevalence of each subtheme; quotes were documented verbatim. Data were collected from transgender users' public vlogs (n=30) self-published on YouTube from 2013 to 2018.

Results: Six major themes were generated from the data analysis. These included the following: functions of diet and exercise; diet and exercise philosophies; “how to” vlogs; advice for success; using dietary supplements; and effects of hormone therapy.

Conclusions: Nutrition-related messages are widely shared among the online transgender community through YouTube. The identified themes reflect topics of interest and expressed needs of transgender individuals. SNSs provide health care providers with a platform to improve patient education and health literacy. Health care providers may actively engage in online discussions to build trust, answer questions, and provide a source of accurate and evidence-based information.},

As expected, individuals who had received HT and/or GAS reported better body satisfaction compared to those who wanted these interventions but had not yet received them. Sexual distress did not differ by transition status. As hypothesized, time since transition began was positively associated with body satisfaction, and there was an indirect relationship between time since transition began and sexual distress through body satisfaction. These results replicated findings in the extant literature suggesting that body satisfaction is improved by GAS. Furthermore, this was the first study of which we are aware to examine the role of time since transition began with respect to body satisfaction and the resulting impact on sexual distress. Results from this study may have clinical implications that could help improve the gender-affirmation experience for transgender individuals.},

	abstract = {Objective
Research examining the prevalence and severity of eating-related psychopathology in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals is limited. This study examined how identity development and minority stress relate to the presence of disordered eating behaviors and cognitions in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals, and improvement at one-year follow-up.
Methods
Data come from a multi-site, longitudinal study of transgender and gender nonbinary individuals (n = 287) and includes assessment of transgender congruence, receipt of gender-affirming care, minority stress, and disordered eating symptoms. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to test for associations between identity development, minority stress, and eating-related psychopathology.
Results
Eighty-three participants (28.9\%) met criteria for current eating-related psychopathology. Loss of control eating was the most commonly endorsed behavior, followed by laxative, diuretic, or other medication use, and compulsive exercise. Higher transgender congruence was associated with lower odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 0.72, 95\% CI 0.55–0.94), whereas increased internalized transphobia was associated with greater odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 1.41, 95\% CI = 1.04–1.91). Participants with eating-related psychopathology had greater odds of having received gender-affirming psychotherapy in the year prior to assessment (OR = 2.33, 95\% CI = 1.32–4.14).
Conclusions
Results suggest that gender identity development and internalized transphobia are associated with eating-related psychopathology in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals. Mental health providers should consider assessing all transgender and gender nonbinary individuals for eating-related psychopathology and unique risk factors associated with disordered eating, including low transgender congruence and internalized transphobia.},

	abstract = {Purpose Research has documented high rates of disordered eating for lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth, but prevalence and patterns of disordered eating among transgender youth remain unexplored. This is despite unique challenges faced by this group, including gender-related body image and the use of hormones. We explore the relationship between disordered eating and risk and protective factors for transgender youth. Methods An online survey of 923 transgender youth (aged 14–25) across Canada was conducted, primarily using measures from existing youth health surveys. Analyses were stratified by gender identity and included logistic regressions with probability profiles to illustrate combinations of risk and protective factors for eating disordered behaviors. Results Enacted stigma (the higher rates of harassment and discrimination sexual minority youth experience) was linked to higher odds of reported past year binge eating and fasting or vomiting to lose weight, while protective factors, including family connectedness, school connectedness, caring friends, and social support, were linked to lower odds of past year disordered eating. Youth with the highest levels of enacted stigma and no protective factors had high probabilities of past year eating disordered behaviors. Discussion Our study found high prevalence of disorders. Risk for these behaviors was linked to stigma and violence exposure, but offset by social supports. Health professionals should assess transgender youth for disordered eating behaviors and supportive resources. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:515–522)},

	abstract = {Objectives: To review evidence from prospective cohort studies of the relationship between hormone therapy and changes in psychological functioning and quality of life in transgender individuals accessing hormone therapy over time.

Data Sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched for relevant studies from inception to November 2014. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched.

Results: Three uncontrolled prospective cohort studies, enrolling 247 transgender adults (180 male-to-female [MTF], 67 female-to-male [FTM]) initiating hormone therapy for the treatment of gender identity disorder (prior diagnostic term for gender dysphoria), were identified. The studies measured exposure to hormone therapy and subsequent changes in mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety) and quality of life outcomes at follow-up. Two studies showed a significant improvement in psychological functioning at 3–6 months and 12 months compared with baseline after initiating hormone therapy. The third study showed improvements in quality of life outcomes 12 months after initiating hormone therapy for FTM and MTF participants; however, only MTF participants showed a statistically significant increase in general quality of life after initiating hormone therapy.

Conclusions: Hormone therapy interventions to improve the mental health and quality of life in transgender people with gender dysphoria have not been evaluated in controlled trials. Low quality evidence suggests that hormone therapy may lead to improvements in psychological functioning. Prospective controlled trials are needed to investigate the effects of hormone therapy on the mental health of transgender people.},

	abstract = {High levels of body dissatisfaction have already been reported in the trans population; however, the root of this dissatisfaction, and its association with eating disordered behaviours, has not been studied in-depth. This study aims to assess eating disorder risk by comparing 200 trans people, 200 people with eating disorders and 200 control participants' scores on three subscales of the Eating Disorders Inventory-2 (EDI-2) and to further explore dissatisfaction in the trans participants using the Hamburg Body Drawing Scale (HBDS). The results showed that overall participants with eating disorders scored higher than trans or control groups on all EDI-2 measures, but that trans individuals had greater body dissatisfaction than control participants and, importantly, trans males had comparable body dissatisfaction scores to eating disordered males. Drive for thinness was greater in females (cis and trans) compared with males. In relation to HBDS body dissatisfaction, both trans males and trans females reported greatest dissatisfaction not only for gender-identifying body parts but also for body shape and weight. Overall, trans males may be at particular risk for eating disordered psychopathology and other body image-related behaviours.
