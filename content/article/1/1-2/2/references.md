- abstract: The paper examines first-hand accounts of differently
    gendered emotional experience of the autism spectrum drawn from
    responses to online surveys, blogs and published autobiographies.
    Analysis of these materials reveals that atypical experiences and
    expressions of gender are considered relatively common among those
    on the spectrum. More literal minded than most, many describe
    meticulous attempts to seek out and solidify gender's troubling
    manifestations in their social worlds, only to find, of course, that
    no such thing as gender exists. However, this oddly absent presence
    continues to haunt autistic emotional lives; its uncanny leavings
    and doings persist, and most (neuro)typical others remain in its
    thrall, seeming to learn gender's nebulous rules as if
    telepathically. First-hand autistic accounts highlight the draining
    and relentless emotional labour that doing gender 'typically'
    requires, and many on the spectrum respond by explicitly rejecting
    or simply neglecting its confounding demands, identifying with
    neither side of the m/f divide in attempts to give up the ghost of
    gender.

- abstract: This article contributes to the burgeoning literatures on
    the sociology of diagnosis and transgender studies by examining the
    relationship between diagnostic processes and the legitimation of
    gender identity---the medicalization of transgender people. In order
    for trans-identified people to access medical and surgical services,
    they must submit to a complex mental health diagnostic process that
    relies on criteria set by the American Psychiatric Association and
    the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH). By
    focusing on provider experiences of using the Gender Identity
    Disorder (GID) diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of
    Mental Health Disorders, Fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR)
    to meet the requirements of WPATH's Standards of Care (SOC-6), we
    show that diagnostic processes can both support and inhibit a
    transpatient's abilities to access services. Participants reveal how
    deeply held cultural views pertaining to gender, mental health, and
    patient competency are entrenched in diagnostic categories. While
    the new DSM-5 has relabeled GID as Gender Dysphoria and the SOC-7
    has somewhat lessened the requirements for accessing hormone
    treatments, our data suggest that these changes will not be enough
    to alter the underlying structure of social control and power that
    diagnostic categories have over transpeople and their providers.

- abstract: Drawing from contemporary blog data, this article examines
    an emerging project termed "neuroqueer." Neuroqueer is a
    collaboration of activists, academics, and bloggers engaging in
    online community building. Neuroqueer requires those who engage in
    it to disidentify from both oppressive dominant and counterculture
    identities that perpetuate destructive medical model discourses of
    cure. It is a queer/crip response to discussions about gender,
    sexuality, and disability as pathology that works to deconstruct
    normative identity categories. Blog members employ neuroqueer
    practices to subversively combat exclusion through rejection of
    able-hetero assimilation and counteridentification in favor of
    disidentification. Of particular interest for this special issue are
    the ways in which neuroqueer perspectives build more fluid
    conceptualizations of both gender and intersectionality through
    conscious disidentification from neurotypical norms and medical
    notions of cure on which they are often unconsciously based.

- abstract: Autistic and non-autistic adults' agreement with scientific
    knowledge about autism, how they define autism, and their
    endorsement of stigmatizing conceptions of autism has not previously
    been examined. Using an online survey, we assessed autism knowledge
    and stigma among 636 adults with varied relationships to autism,
    including autistic people and nuclear family members. Autistic
    participants exhibited more scientifically based knowledge than
    others. They were more likely to describe autism experientially or
    as a neutral difference, and more often opposed the medical model.
    Autistic participants and family members reported lower stigma.
    Greater endorsement of the importance of normalizing autistic people
    was associated with heightened stigma. Findings suggest that
    autistic adults should be considered autism experts and involved as
    partners in autism research.

- abstract: Introduction There is a growing clinical recognition that a
    significant proportion of patients with gender dysphoria have
    concurrent autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Aim The purpose of this
    review is to systematically appraise the current literature
    regarding the co-occurrence of gender dysphoria and ASD. Methods A
    systematic literature search using Medline and PubMed, PsycINFO, and
    Embase was conducted from 1966 to July 2015. Main Outcome Measures
    Fifty-eight articles were generated from the search. Nineteen of
    these publications met the inclusion criteria. Results The
    literature investigating ASD in children and adolescents with gender
    dysphoria showed a higher prevalence rate of ASD compared with the
    general population. There is a limited amount of research in adults.
    Only one study showed that adults attending services for gender
    dysphoria had increased ASD scores. Another study showed a larger
    proportion of adults with atypical gender identity and ASD.
    Conclusion Although the research is limited, especially for adults,
    there is an increasing amount of evidence that suggests a
    co-occurrence between gender dysphoria and ASD. Further research is
    vital for educational and clinical purposes.

- abstract: Autism narratives are not just stories or histories,
    describing a given reality. They are creating the language in which
    to describe the experience of autism, and hence helping to forge the
    concepts in which to think autism. This paper focuses on a series of
    autobiographies that began with Grandin's Emergence. These are often
    said to show us autism from the 'inside'. The paper proposes that
    instead they are developing ways to describe experience for which
    there is little pre-existing language. Wittgenstein has many
    well-known aphorisms about how we understand other people directly,
    without inference. They condense what he had found in Wolfgang
    Köhler's Gestalt Psychology. These phenomena of direct understanding
    what other people are doing are, Köhler wrote, 'the common property
    and practice of mankind'. They are not the common property and
    practice of people with autism. Ordinary language is rich in age-old
    ways to describe what others are thinking, feeling and so forth.
    Köhler's phenomena are the bedrock on which such language rests.
    There is no such discourse for autism, because Köhler's phenomena
    are absent. But a new discourse is being made up right now, i.e.
    ways of talking for which the autobiographies serve as working
    prototypes.

- abstract: "Individuals who experience a gender identity that is
    discordant with biological sex are increasingly presenting to
    physicians for assistance in alleviating associated psychological
    distress. In contrast to prior efforts to identify and primarily
    address underlying psychiatric contributors to gender dysphoria,
    interventions that include uncritical social affirmation, use of
    gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to suppress normally timed
    puberty, and administration of cross-sex steroid hormones to induce
    desired secondary sex characteristics are now advocated by an
    emerging cohort of transgender medicine specialists. For patients
    with persistent gender dysphoria, surgery is offered to alter the
    appearance of breasts and genital organs. Efforts to address ethical
    concerns regarding this contentious treatment paradigm are dependent
    upon reliable evidence on immediate and long-term risks and
    benefits. Although strong recommendations have been made for
    invasive and potentially irreversible interventions, high-quality
    scientific data on the effects of this approach are generally
    lacking. Limitations of the existing transgender literature include
    general lack of randomized prospective trial design, small sample
    size, recruitment bias, short study duration, high subject dropout
    rates, and reliance on ?expert? opinion. Existing data reveal
    significant intervention-associated morbidity and raise serious
    concern that the primary goal of suicide prevention is not achieved.
    In addition to substantial moral questions, adherence to established
    principles of evidence-based medicine necessitates a high degree of
    caution in accepting gender-affirming medical interventions as a
    preferred treatment approach. Continued consideration and rigorous
    investigation of alternate approaches to alleviating suffering in
    people with gender dysphoria are warranted.Summary:This paper
    provides an overview of what is currently known about people who
    experience a gender identity that differs from their biological sex
    and the associated desire to engage the medical profession in
    alleviating associated discomfort and distress. The scientific
    evidence used to support current recommendations for affirming one?s
    preferred gender, halting normally timed puberty, administering
    cross-sex hormones, and surgically altering primary and secondary
    sexual traits are summarized and critically evaluated. Serious
    deficits in understanding the cause of this condition, the reasons
    for the marked increase in people presenting for medical care,
    together with immediate and long-term risks relative to benefit of
    medical intervention are exposed."

- abstract: "The prevalence of nontraditional gender identities in many
    autistic people raises provocative questions for feminist scholars.
    In particular, autistic writers often invite alternative
    understandings of sex/gender as a multiple, rhetorical phenomenon.
    Autobiographies, blogs, and Internet posts show how autistic
    individuals view gender as a copia, or tool for inventing multiple
    possibilities through available sex/gender discourses. Four
    particular discourses emerge through which autistic people
    understand gender: identification, neurodiversity, performance, and
    queer identity."

- abstract: The rhetorical figure of the incrementum, or scale, can help
    to account for how autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been
    gendered as male, especially in Simon Baron-Cohen's \"Extreme Male
    Brain\" theory. The incrementum occurs when female, male, and
    autistic brains are placed along a scale according to systemizing
    and empathizing abilities. This double hierarchy reinforces popular
    beliefs about sex and gender, drawing on the cultural resources of
    hi-tech culture, the service economy, and geekiness. In so doing,
    these theories overlook other important aspects of ASD, including
    alternative theories, the presence of autistic women and girls, and
    the needs and interests of autistic people themselves.

- abstract: Transgender (trans) people experience high rates of mental
    health issues including depression and suicidality. Improving access
    to transition-related medicine such as hormones and surgeries is
    suggested as an important mechanism to address these mental health
    issues. Yet clinicians experience challenges assessing and referring
    trans people for transition-related medicine. Standardized
    assessment protocols have been therefore recommended to optimize
    care. Although standardized protocols are purported to expand access
    to hormones and surgeries for trans people, it is unclear whether
    these tools achieve this goal. We therefore conducted an
    institutional ethnography to explicate how standardized readiness
    assessments coordinate access to hormones and surgeries in Canada.
    We analyzed key texts, talked with trans people, clinicians,
    clinician-educators, and administrators (total n = 22), and observed
    clinician-education workshops. In the context of determining
    transition readiness, standardized protocols direct clinicians to
    explore alternative diagnoses and assess the degree to which any
    complex mental health condition is "managed" prior to initiating
    hormones or surgeries. In response, we found that trans patients
    downplay or withhold mental health concerns from clinicians, or
    otherwise do additional work (e.g., take up unwanted psychiatric
    interventions) to convince providers they are "mentally ready" to
    transition. This phenomenon is paradoxical in that
    transition-related medicine is recommended to mitigate trans
    people's psychosocial distress, but when patients reveal symptoms of
    distress they encounter significant barriers to treatment. We
    conclude that the logic underpinning pre-transition "mental
    readiness" assessments discredits the claim that standardized
    protocols optimize access to hormones and surgeries.

- abstract: Obtaining deep-level insights into the thoughts, actions,
    and emotions of organizational leaders can pose significant
    challenges to organizational scholars. Fortunately, a promising but
    largely untapped resource to provide such insights
    exists---autobiographies. We begin by providing an overview of
    autobiographies as a data source, including their benefits and
    limitations. We then discuss where autobiographies could contribute
    to theory development in organizational research, highlighting the
    areas of strategic leadership and entrepreneurship, identity, and
    sensemaking. To provide direction on how to incorporate these texts
    into a research design, we provide several research ideas and
    guidelines about how autobiographies could be used in a triangulated
    research design. We illustrate their use in a recent study conducted
    among craft entrepreneurs to confirm existing findings and document
    a series of planned studies using autobiographies to explore new
    findings. Together, the study, although focusing on autobiographies,
    offers a broader framework to advance the use of narrative forms in
    organizational scholarship.

- abstract: "More than 35 years ago I developed the basic procedures of
    a qualitative content analysis which are still widely used in
    qualitative oriented social science text analysis. I want to give an
    overview of the reception and recent developments of this
    approach.Three topics are elaborated in this article: First the
    theoretical background of qualitative content analysis is summarized
    and compared to other approaches of social science text analysis.
    This includes a differentiation of quantitative content analysis. In
    quantitative content analysis the process of categorization is
    running automatically, following a fixed algorithm, whereas in
    qualitative content analysis the assignment of categories to text
    passages always remains an act of interpretation. But this process
    strictly follows rules of interpretation. Second, the reception of
    my conception of qualitative content analysis is retraced and some
    misunderstandings cleared up. Additionally, the approach of
    qualitative content analysis proposed by Margrit SCHREIER and Udo
    KUCKARTZ is compared to my concept. This is demonstrated with an
    example. Third, recent developments are reviewed and free available
    software especially developed for qualitative content analysis
    (QCAmap) is introduced."

- abstract: In recent decades there has been much debate over the
    ontological status of autism and other neurological 'disorders',
    diagnosed by behavioural indicators, and theorised primarily within
    the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychological paradigms.
    Such cognitive-behavioural discourses abstain from acknowledging the
    universal issue of relationality and interaction in the formation of
    a contested and constantly reconstructed social reality, produced
    through the agency of its 'actors'. The nature of these contested
    interactions will be explored in this current issues piece through
    the use of the term the 'double empathy problem', and how such a
    rendition produces a critique of autism being defined as a deficit
    in 'theory of mind', re-framing such issues as a question of
    reciprocity and mutuality. In keeping with other autistic
    self-advocates, this piece will refer to 'autistic people', and
    'those who identify as on the autism spectrum', rather than 'people
    with autism'.

- abstract: "The desire for transgender futures has grown exponentially
    in recent years, but many of these futures are traps, concealing a
    demand to assume normative and neoliberal priorities in exchange for
    citizenship and belonging. This article argues that some of these
    traps might be undone through autistic disruption. Dwelling with the
    life writing and memoir of individuals both autistic and trans, it
    suggests that, by choice or by circumstance, autistic-trans
    narratives defy the chrononormative mandate of the able-minded
    future. By claiming autism and gender nonconformity as mutually
    inclusive, foregrounding alternative sensorealities, and
    interrupting the incitement to get better, this article argues that
    cripping trans time through autistic disruption offers what Gossett,
    Stanley, and Burton call a \"trap door\": a route of escape from the
    normate trans future and a way for autistic life to insist on its
    own continuation and survivance."

- abstract: "Purpose: There is evolving evidence that children and
    adolescents with gender dysphoria have higher-than-expected rates of
    autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet clinical data on ASD among youth
    with gender dysphoria remain limited, particularly in North America.
    This report aims to fill this gap.Methods: We conducted a
    retrospective review of patient chart data from 39 consecutive youth
    ages 8 to 20 years (mean age 15.8 years, natal male: n = 22, natal
    female: n = 17) presenting for evaluation at a multidisciplinary
    gender clinic in a large U.S. pediatric hospital from 2007 to 2011
    to evaluate the prevalence of ASD in this patient
    population.Results: Overall, 23.1% of patients (9/39) presenting
    with gender dysphoria had possible, likely, or very likely Asperger
    syndrome as measured by the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale
    (ASDS).Conclusion: These findings are consistent with growing
    evidence supporting increased prevalence of ASD in gender dysphoric
    children. To guide provision of optimal clinical care and
    therapeutic intervention, routine assessment of ASD is recommended
    in youth presenting for gender dysphoria."

- abstract: "Evidence indicates an overrepresentation of youth with
    co-occurring autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and gender dysphoria
    (GD). The clinical assessment and treatment of adolescents with this
    co-occurrence is often complex, related to the developmental aspects
    of ASD. There are no guidelines for clinical care when ASD and GD
    co-occur; however, there are clinicians and researchers experienced
    in this co-occurrence. This study develops initial clinical
    consensus guidelines for the assessment and care of adolescents with
    co-occurring ASD and GD, from the best clinical practices of current
    experts in the field. Expert participants were identified through a
    comprehensive international search process and invited to
    participate in a two-stage Delphi procedure to form clinical
    consensus statements. The Delphi Method is a well-studied research
    methodology for obtaining consensus among experts to define
    appropriate clinical care. Of 30 potential experts identified, 22
    met criteria as expert in co-occurring ASD and GD youth and
    participated. Textual data divided into the following data nodes:
    guidelines for assessment; guidelines for treatment; six primary
    clinical/psychosocial challenges: social functioning, medical
    treatments and medical safety, risk of victimization/safety, school,
    and transition to adulthood issues (i.e., employment and romantic
    relationships). With a cutoff of 75% consensus for inclusion,
    identified experts produced a set of initial guidelines for clinical
    care. Primary themes include the importance of assessment for GD in
    ASD, and vice versa, as well as an extended diagnostic period, often
    with overlap/blurring of treatment and assessment."

- abstract: "Despite research exploring autism in gender-diverse
    adolescents, no studies have elicited these individuals'
    perspectives. In-depth interviews with 22 well-characterized
    autistic gender-diverse adolescents revealed critical themes,
    including: recollections of pre-pubertal gender nonconformity; vivid
    experiences of gender dysphoria; a fear of social gender expression
    due to perceived animosity toward transgender people; and specific
    challenges that result from the interplay of gender diversity and
    neurodiversity. During the \\~ 22 month study social gender
    affirmation increased in six participants and gender dysphoria
    attenuated in four participants. Given the ethical imperative to
    understand and prioritize the voiced perspectives and needs of
    autistic gender minority adolescents as well as the discovery of
    shared themes and experiences in this population, results should
    inform clinical research approaches and priorities."

- abstract: Philosophical arguments regarding academic freedom can
    sometimes appear removed from the real conflicts playing out in
    contemporary universities. This paper focusses on a set of issues at
    the front line of these conflicts, namely, questions regarding sex,
    gender and gender identity. We document the ways in which the work
    of academics has been affected by political activism around these
    questions and, drawing on our respective disciplinary expertise as a
    sociologist and a philosopher, elucidate the costs of curtailing
    discussion on fundamental demographic and conceptual categories. We
    discuss some philosophical work that addresses the conceptual
    distinction between academic freedom and free speech and explore how
    these notions are intertwined in significant ways in universities.
    Our discussion elucidates and emphasises the educational costs of
    curtailing academic freedom.

- abstract: Studies have shown an increase of symptoms of autism
    spectrum disorder (ASD) in gender dysphoria (GD). Various hypotheses
    try to explain this possible co-occurrence (e.g., a role of
    resistance to change, stereotyped behaviors or prenatal testosterone
    exposure). This study examined ASD symptoms with the Children's
    Social Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ) in 490 children with GD
    compared to 2507 typically developing (TD) and 196 children with
    ASD. CSBQ total scores of the GD sample were in between scores from
    the TD and ASD sample. The GD sample showed elevated levels of
    autistic symptomatology on all subdomains, not only on stereotyped
    and resistance to change. Further, no gender differences and
    interaction effects were found on the total CSBQ, making a sole role
    for prenatal testosterone unlikely.

- abstract: "The current literature shows growing evidence of a link
    between gender dysphoria (GD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
    This study reviews the available clinical and empirical data. A
    systematic search of the literature was conducted using the
    following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus;
    utilizing different combinations of the following search terms:
    autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger's disorder (AD),
    co-morbidity, gender dysphoria (GD), gender identity disorder (GID),
    transgenderism and transsexualism. In total, 25 articles and reports
    were selected and discussed. Information was grouped by found
    co-occurrence rates, underlying hypotheses and implications for
    diagnosis and treatment. GD and ASD were found to co-occur
    frequently -- sometimes characterized by atypical presentation of
    GD, which makes a correct diagnosis and determination of treatment
    options for GD difficult. Despite these challenges there are several
    case reports describing gender affirming treatment of co-occurring
    GD in adolescents and adults with ASD. Various underlying hypotheses
    for the link between GD and ASD were suggested, but almost all of
    them lack evidence."

- abstract: Prior research has shown an elevation in autism traits and
    diagnoses in individuals seen for gender related consultation and in
    participants self-identifying as transgender. To investigate this
    relationship between autism and gender identity from a new angle, we
    compared the self-reported autism traits and sensory differences
    between participants with autism who did or did not identify with
    their assigned sex (i.e. cisgender or trans and non-binary,
    respectively). We found broad elevation of most cognitive autism
    traits in the trans and non-binary group (those who identified with
    a gender other than their assigned gender), and lower visual and
    auditory hypersensitivity. We contrast these data to existing
    hypotheses and propose a role for autistic resistance to social
    conditioning.

- abstract: We assessed whether recent psychological literature on
    children reflects or contrasts with the zeitgeist of American
    Psychological Association's recent non-discrimination statement on
    'transgender' and 'gender variant' individuals. Article records (N =
    94) on childhood 'gender identity' and 'expression' published
    between 1999 and 2008 inclusive were evaluated for two kinds of
    cisgenderism, the ideology that invalidates or pathologises
    self-designated genders that contrast with external designations.
    Misgendering language contradicts children's own gender assignations
    and was less frequent than pathologising language which constructs
    children's own gender assignations and expression as disordered.
    Articles on children's gender identity/expression are increasingly
    impactful within psychology. Cisgenderism is neither increasing nor
    decreasing overall. Mental health professionals are more
    cisgenderist than other authors. Articles by members of an
    'invisible college' structured around the most prolific author in
    this area are more cisgenderist and impactful than other articles.
    We suggest how authors and editors can implement American
    Psychological Association policy and change scientific discourse
    about children's genders.

- abstract: The question of judicial protection of trans people has come
    to the fore in recent years, culminating in Bill C-16 which added
    gender identity and gender expression to the federal
    anti-discrimination and hate crime laws. In this article, the author
    contests the notion that anti-discrimination and hate crime laws are
    effective in mitigating anti-trans harassment, discrimination, and
    violence. Suggesting that the model of anti-trans acts which
    underlies anti-discrimination and hate crime laws is erroneous, the
    author argues that the law's impact on trans well-being will be
    modest and that a careful analysis of anti-trans attitudes enables
    us to identify a number of more effective governmental avenues
    toward trans emancipation.

- abstract: Youth explore their genders -- both theirs and those of
    others. Exploration is not only a vessel of discovery and
    understanding but also of creation. Centring the notion of gender
    exploration, this article inquires into the ethical issues
    surrounding care for transgender youth. Arguing that exploration is
    best seen not as a precondition to transition-related care but as a
    process that can operate through transitioning, the article
    concludes that the gender-affirmative approach to trans youth care
    best fosters youth's capacity for healthy exploration. Unbounded
    social transition and ready access to puberty blockers ought to be
    treated as the default option, and support should be offered to
    parents who may have difficulty accepting their youth.

- abstract: The term 'rapid-onset gender dysphoria' (ROGD) was coined in
    2016 to describe an alleged epidemic of youth coming out as trans
    'out of the blue' due to social contagion and mental illness. The
    term reflects a deliberate attempt to weaponise scientific-sounding
    language to dismiss mounting empirical evidence of the benefits of
    transition. This article offers an introduction to the theory of
    ROGD and its history, presents a detailed critique of the empirical
    and theoretical claims associated with the theory, and highlights
    structural concerns with the ROGD discourse. The article argues that
    claims associated with ROGD, including assertions of declining
    mental health and degrading familial relationships following coming
    out, are best explained by the leading ROGD study's recruitment of
    parents from transantagonistic websites against a background of
    growing visibility and social acceptance of trans people. ROGD
    theory is best understood as an attempt to circumvent existing
    research demonstrating the importance of gender affirmation, relying
    on scientific-sounding language to achieve respectability.

- abstract: Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely
    acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within
    psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and
    theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We
    outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other
    qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and
    in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions.
    We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic
    analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and
    consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis.
    Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic
    analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful
    and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond
    psychology.

- abstract: Gender Identity Disorder of Childhood (GIDC)---a psychiatric
    diagnosis given to gendervariant children---has been controversial
    since its creation. Critics inside and outside of the mental health
    professions have called for the removal or revision of GIDC, arguing
    that it has served to pathologize homosexuality, to enforce
    normative notions of masculinity and femininity, and to recast a
    social problem as individual pathology. Drawing on published
    clinical and research papers, archival materials, and interviews
    with clinicians, researchers, and advocates, this article analyzes
    early studies of gendervariant boys from the 1960s and 1970s and
    describes the process through which the GIDC diagnosis was created.
    The article examines some of the limitations of current debates over
    GIDC and points out new trends that hold the most promise for
    providing support to gender-variant children.

- abstract: "Background: Transgender and non-binary children and young
    people and their parents in England, UK are poorly served across a
    range of healthcare settings. Whilst UK equalities legislation and
    international guidance on transgender healthcare pathways protects
    this group from discrimination and mandates an affirmative approach,
    services in England are not keeping pace.Aims: This study aims to
    draw on the experiences of transgender and non-binary children,
    young people and their parents in a support group in England in
    order to investigate their experiences of healthcare provision, and
    to develop some ideas for improvement.Method: Data was collected
    with participants in a family support group which offers a parent
    helpline service, social groups for children and parents, and
    training for schools and other organizations. 65 parents and
    children from 27 families from the family support group attended
    participatory workshops where they were given a range of briefs:
    \"health,\" \"family,\" \"friends,\" and \"education.\" Their participation
    involved being asked to define their own interview questions and
    collect data by interviewing each other. Their interview notes
    constituted the raw data. Data was coded inductively by the author
    with respondent checking as a second stage.Results: Results
    constitute the views of a small group of people, so cannot be
    generalized. However, they do illustrate some of the issues which
    may arise. Participants' experiences elicited five key themes:
    professionals' perceived lack of clinical and therapeutic knowledge;
    mental distress caused by excessive waiting lists; professionals'
    stereotyped gender assumptions; direct discrimination within
    healthcare settings; and a lack of attention to parent and child
    voice, especially in terms of school-based experiences and where a
    patient had a diagnosis of autism."

- abstract: Background Trans and non-binary children and young people in
    England, UK struggle to gain access to affirming clinical care,
    despite the international research evidence pointing toward this
    best practice approach. Concurrently, they are subject to constant
    discussion in the UK national media and politics, where many
    negative assumptions are made about their needs, experiences and
    clinical provision. Their journey to seek appropriate care has not
    yet been documented.Aims We trace the experiences of trans and
    non-binary children and youth and their families in their decision
    to seek, searches for and experiences with affirmative and
    non-affirmative clinical input for help with their gender.Method 27
    dyadic, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with trans and
    non-binary children and young people and their parents from 13
    families.Results The process of seeking support via National Health
    Service clinical routes in England, UK is beset with lengthy waiting
    lists, issues with geographical inaccessibility, a lack of relevant
    clinical knowledge, and a failure to recognize the value of family
    expertise. Family doctors provide contraceptive hormones in lieu of
    proper access to puberty blocking or gender affirming hormones, and
    most families resort to private care they can ill afford.Discussion
    Training in gender identity and gender dysphoria is recommended for
    both family doctors, and children's mental health services. Gender
    identity development services could be decentralized, with local
    hubs offering more accessible support.

- abstract: "In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
    Manual of Mental Disorders, the American Psychiatric Association has
    changed the diagnosis of gender identity disorder to gender
    dysphoria (GD). In this critical narrative review we ask: What is
    gender dysphoria? We report on some of the inconsistencies in the
    articles that foreground distress while obfuscating the fact that
    not all trans and intersex people suffer stress or impaired
    functioning, and the inappropriate referencing to intersex people in
    the diagnostic criterion, claims about the GD diagnosis contributing
    to the depathologization of and reducing stigma surrounding trans
    people, the conceptualizations of \"gender dysphoric\" research
    subjects, and finally we question the etiological approaches using
    GD as a conceptual framework. We further suggest that there are a
    number of methodological issues that need to be resolved to be able
    to claim that the GD diagnosis can be validated. To shed light on
    these paradoxes and methodological issues in the DSM-5, we report on
    the content validity of GD by reviewing research articles
    postdiagnostic inception. These findings will contribute to the
    debate about the validity of GD as a diagnosis for the 21st century
    for those people who need to live a different gender to that
    assigned at birth."

- abstract: Although increasing numbers of children have socially
    transitioned to live in line with their gender identities, little is
    known about factors associated with their wellbeing. This study
    examines the associations between parent-reported family, peer, and
    school support for a youth's gender identity, as well as an
    objective measure of state-level support, with parent-reported
    internalizing symptoms in 265 transgender youth (67.2% transgender
    girls, 32.8% transgender boys), ages 3--15 years (M = 9.41,
    SD = 2.62). Parents who reported higher levels of family, peer, and
    school support for their child's gender identity also reported fewer
    internalizing symptoms; the objective measure of state-level support
    was not related to internalizing symptoms. Additionally, peer and
    school support buffered against the association between
    gender-related victimization and internalizing symptoms, as reported
    by parents. This work demonstrates that even among transgender youth
    with families who supported their transitions, parents see better
    well-being in their children when they also see more support for the
    child's gender identity from family, peers, and schools.

    gender as a web that weaves together nature, nurture, and culture
    and allows for a myriad of healthy gender outcomes. This article
    presents concepts of true gender self, false gender self, and gender
    creativity as they operationalize in clinical work with children who
    need therapeutic supports to establish an authentic gender self
    while developing strategies for negotiating an environment resistant
    to that self. Categories of gender nonconforming children are
    outlined and excerpts of a treatment of a young transgender child
    are presented to illustrate true gender self child therapy.

- abstract: "The treatment of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD)
    prepubertal children has expanded both in scope and in the number of
    families seeking services over the past decade. This chapter reviews
    the extant standards of care and clinical guidelines for these
    children, synthesizing the WPATH, American Psychological
    Association, and Australian Standards of Care, while illustrating
    the ascendant approach for supporting these children: the gender
    affirmative model. The model is contrasted to earlier developed
    models of care, the \"living in your own skin\" model and the
    \"watchful waiting\" model. To illustrate the clinical approach of the
    gender affirmative model in contrast to the other two models, a
    hypothetical case of a young gender-exploring child is presented,
    with an analysis of how each of the three models might approach the
    child and family seeking care."

- abstract: An increasing number of transgender children---those who
    express a gender identity that is "opposite" their natal sex---are
    socially transitioning, or presenting as their gender identity in
    everyday life. This study asks whether these children differ from
    gender-typical peers on basic gender development tasks. Three- to
    5-year-old socially transitioned transgender children (n = 36) did
    not differ from controls matched on age and expressed gender (n =
    36), or siblings of transgender and gender nonconforming children (n
    = 24) on gender preference, behavior, and belief measures. However,
    transgender children were less likely than both control groups to
    believe that their gender at birth matches their current gender,
    whereas both transgender children and siblings were less likely than
    controls to believe that other people's gender is stable.

- abstract: "Background: Pediatric gender clinics have a long history of
    analyzing and scrutinizing parents of trans children. At present,
    gender services in countries like the UK continue to hold clinical
    sessions with parents of pre-adolescent transgender children,
    sometimes extending over many years. Clinician viewpoints dominate
    the limited existing literature, with little analysis of the
    perspectives of parents of trans children.Aims: The study aimed to
    understand the experiences that parents of socially transitioned
    pre-adolescent trans children have had in UK gender clinics.Methods:
    Data were drawn from semi-structured qualitative interviews with 30
    UK-based parents of socially transitioned trans children -- children
    who socially transitioned, for example, changed pronoun, under the
    age of eleven. This article analyzed a subset of a wider dataset,
    focusing on data from 23 parents relating to parental engagement
    with UK NHS gender clinics before their child reached
    adolescence.Results: Themes emerging from the dataset included
    parents feeling under a microscope, and parents finding gender
    clinic sessions judgemental, intrusive and inappropriate.
    Interviewees reported clinician discouragement of listening to and
    validating their children, as well as a lack of emotional
    support.Discussion: The article presents evidence of continued
    pathologisation and problematisation of childhood gender diversity
    in parental engagements with UK children's gender clinics. It
    concludes by contrasting current UK practice as described in
    parental accounts with gender affirmative approaches to supporting
    parents of trans children."

- abstract: "Transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGN) youth are at
    increased risk for adverse mental health outcomes, but better family
    functioning may be protective. This study describes TGN youth's
    mental health and associations with family functioning in a
    community-based sample. Participants were from 33 families (96
    family members) and included 33 TGN youth, ages 13 to 17 years; 48
    cisgender (non-transgender) caregivers; and 15 cisgender siblings.
    Participants completed a survey with measures of family functioning
    (family communication, family satisfaction) and mental health of TGN
    youth (suicidality, self-harm, depression, anxiety, self-esteem,
    resilience). TGN youth reported a high risk of mental health
    concerns: suicidality (15% to 30%), self-harm (49%), clinically
    significant depressive symptoms (61%); and moderate self-esteem (M =
    27.55, SD = 7.15) and resiliency (M = 3.67, SD = 0.53). In adjusted
    models, better family functioning from the TGN youth's perspective
    was associated with better mental health outcomes among TGN youth (β
    ranged from −0.40 to −0.65 for self-harm, depressive symptoms, and
    anxious symptoms, and 0.58 to 0.70 for self-esteem and resiliency).
    Findings from this study highlight the importance of considering TGN
    youth's perspectives on the family to inform interventions to
    improve family functioning in families with TGN youth."

- abstract: "Purpose: We examined associations between family rejection
    and risk of suicide attempts and substance misuse among a national
    sample of transgender and gender nonconforming adults.Methods: Data
    were drawn from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey
    (N = 6456). This secondary analysis was restricted to 3458
    individuals who self-identified as transgender or gender
    nonconforming and provided complete data on study variables. We used
    multivariable logistic regression to examine health risks by level
    of reported family rejection (low/moderate/high), controlling for
    relevant sociodemographic characteristics.Results: Overall, 42.3% of
    the sample reported a suicide attempt and 26.3% reported misusing
    drugs or alcohol to cope with transgender-related discrimination.
    After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex assigned at birth,
    binary gender identity, income, education, and employment status,
    family rejection was associated with increased odds of both
    behaviors. Odds increased significantly with increasing levels of
    family rejection.Conclusions: Family rejection related to gender
    identity is an understudied interpersonal stressor that may
    negatively affect health outcomes for transgender and gender
    nonconforming individuals. A better understanding of the role of
    close relationships in both risk and resilience for transgender
    individuals is critical in the development of effective public
    health interventions for this community."

- abstract: The present study represents findings from interviews with
    five mothers, each of whom had a transgender child. All of the
    transgender children were natal/biological males between the ages of
    8 and 11 years old and had socially transitioned to living as girls.
    Ehrensaft's (2012) notion of the "true gender self" was integrated
    with an ecological perspective to examine multiple interacting
    contexts, including family, neighborhood, and school, in which the
    participants lived. An overarching theme of "transformation" (or
    lack thereof) was used to organize the findings in relation to the
    transgender children, their families, and their communities. Changes
    in relation to the children's demeanor and well-being before and
    after their social transitions (e.g., from shy and depressed to
    happy and well-adjusted), the parents' and other family members'
    feelings and reactions to the children's gender identities and
    expressions over time (e.g., health care professionals and school
    staff learning along with and from the families), and the responses
    of others in the community (e.g., lack of knowledgeable health care
    professionals and school personnel) are discussed. Findings have
    implications for practice and future research.

- abstract: "Research Findings: Under the United Nations Convention on
    the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), children have the right to express
    their views on all matters affecting them and to have those views
    given due weight. This right applies in the context of research;
    however, examples of young children being engaged as co-researchers
    remain rare. Practice or Policy: This article examines the
    implications of adopting an explicit UNCRC-informed approach to
    engaging children as co-researchers. It draws on a research project
    that sought to ascertain young children's views on after-school
    programs and that involved a university-based research team working
    along with 2 groups of co-researchers; each composed of 4 children
    aged 4 to 5. The article discusses the contribution made by children
    to the development of the research questions and choice of methods
    and their involvement in the interpretation of the data and
    dissemination of the findings. It suggests that, although there are
    limits to what young children can and will want to do in the context
    of adult-led research studies, an explicit UNCRC-informed approach
    requires the adoption of supportive strategies that can assist
    children to engage in a meaningful way, with consequent benefits for
    the research findings and outputs."

- abstract: Purpose  Standards for reporting exist for many types of
    quantitative research, but currently none exist for the broad
    spectrum of qualitative research. The purpose of the present study
    was to formulate and define standards for reporting qualitative
    research while preserving the requisite flexibility to accommodate
    various paradigms, approaches, and methods. Method  The authors
    identified guidelines, reporting standards, and critical appraisal
    criteria for qualitative research by searching PubMed, Web of
    Science, and Google through July 2013; reviewing the reference lists
    of retrieved sources; and contacting experts. Specifically, two
    authors reviewed a sample of sources to generate an initial set of
    items that were potentially important in reporting qualitative
    research. Through an iterative process of reviewing sources,
    modifying the set of items, and coding all sources for items, the
    authors prepared a near-final list of items and descriptions and
    sent this list to five external reviewers for feedback. The final
    items and descriptions included in the reporting standards reflect
    this feedback. Results  The Standards for Reporting Qualitative
    Research (SRQR) consists of 21 items. The authors define and explain
    key elements of each item and provide examples from recently
    published articles to illustrate ways in which the standards can be
    met. Conclusions  The SRQR aims to improve the transparency of all
    aspects of qualitative research by providing clear standards for
    reporting qualitative research. These standards will assist authors
    during manuscript preparation, editors and reviewers in evaluating a
    manuscript for potential publication, and readers when critically
    appraising, applying, and synthesizing study findings.

- abstract: Internationally and within New Zealand there has been a
    substantial increase in the demand for gender affirming healthcare
    over the past decade. The Youth'12 secondary school survey,
    estimated that approximately 1.2% of adolescents in New Zealand
    identify as transgender.¹ It is likely that this level of referrals
    to health services will continue in the foreseeable future. This
    guideline has been developed following the recognition that New
    Zealand's previous good practice guide, Gender Reassignment Health
    Services for Trans People within New Zealand,² which was based
    heavily on the World Professional Association of Transgender Health,
    Standards of Care, version 6 (WPATH SOC v6),³ requires updating to
    be in step with current practice and international guidelines.
    Transgender healthcare is a rapidly evolving area of medicine. WPATH
    is the international body responsible for producing standards of
    care. WPATH SOC v7,⁴ was published soon after New Zealand's good
    practice guide and version 8 is currently in development. This
    guideline is not intended to replace the WPATH SOC but to present
    additional guidance for the provision of gender affirming healthcare
    in Aotearoa, New Zealand. We hope that this guide will be used to
    support the development of health services providing gender
    affirming healthcare around the country and provide guidance to
    District Health Boards (DHBs). We use Sir Mason Durie's health
    framework to inform the kaupapa or approach of these guidelines.
    WPATH SOC v7 encourages culturally appropriate approaches which are
    contextually based.⁴ Durie's model for health promotion development,
    Te Pae Māhutonga (the Southern Cross), has two guiding principles
    which correspond to the pointer stars of the constellation, Te Mana
    Whakahaere and Ngā Manukura.⁵

- abstract: Transgender children who have socially transitioned, that
    is, who identify as the gender "opposite" their natal sex and are
    supported to live openly as that gender, are increasingly visible in
    society, yet we know nothing about their mental health. Previous
    work with children with gender identity disorder (GID; now termed
    gender dysphoria) has found remarkably high rates of anxiety and
    depression in these children. Here we examine, for the first time,
    mental health in a sample of socially transitioned transgender
    children.A community-based national sample of transgender,
    prepubescent children (n = 73, aged 3--12 years), along with control
    groups of nontransgender children in the same age range (n = 73 age-
    and gender-matched community controls; n = 49 sibling of transgender
    participants), were recruited as part of the TransYouth Project.
    Parents completed anxiety and depression measures.Transgender
    children showed no elevations in depression and slightly elevated
    anxiety relative to population averages. They did not differ from
    the control groups on depression symptoms and had only marginally
    higher anxiety symptoms.Socially transitioned transgender children
    who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally
    normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in
    anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within
    this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of
    children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have
    notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously
    reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.

- abstract: "A visible and growing cohort of transgender children in
    North America live according to their expressed gender rather than
    their natal sex, yet scientific research has largely ignored this
    population. In the current study, we adopted methodological advances
    from social-cognition research to investigate whether 5- to
    12-year-old prepubescent transgender children (N = 32), who were
    presenting themselves according to their gender identity in everyday
    life, showed patterns of gender cognition more consistent with their
    expressed gender or their natal sex, or instead appeared to be
    confused about their gender identity. Using implicit and explicit
    measures, we found that transgender children showed a clear pattern:
    They viewed themselves in terms of their expressed gender and showed
    preferences for their expressed gender, with response patterns
    mirroring those of two cisgender (nontransgender) control groups.
    These results provide evidence that, early in development,
    transgender youth are statistically indistinguishable from cisgender
    children of the same gender identity."

- abstract: This article proposes that survival may be considered a
    research method for social researchers, especially if they are
    undertaking fieldwork within marginalised communities of which they
    are a part. Drawing on an autoethnographic account of conducting
    research while trans, it shows how marginalised researchers may
    encounter both challenges common within the neoliberal university,
    and troubles specific to the researcher's social identity, touching
    on experiences of casualisation, distressing fieldwork, trauma, and
    suicide. The article concludes that marginalised researchers should
    not be held individually responsible for their own survival; rather,
    they require the active support of research communities and
    institutional frameworks.

- abstract: Chosen name use among transgender youth (youth whose gender
    identities are different from their sex assigned at birth) can be
    part of the complex process of aligning gender presentation with
    gender identity and can promote mental health. However, little is
    known about the factors that predict whether or not transgender
    youth have a chosen name and outcomes of chosen name use, especially
    in specific social contexts. We examined, among a sample of 129
    transgender youth from three cities in the United States,
    differences in sociodemographic characteristics and mental health
    outcomes between transgender youth with and without a chosen name
    and, among those with a chosen name, predictors and mental health
    benefits of being able to use a chosen name at home, school, and
    work. There were few differences between transgender youth with and
    without a chosen name. Among transgender youth with a chosen name,
    disclosure of gender identity to supportive family and teachers
    predicted chosen name use at home and school, respectively. Chosen
    name use was associated with large reductions in negative health
    outcomes and relatively smaller improvements in positive mental
    health outcomes. Our results show that chosen name use is part of
    the gender affirmation process for some, but not all, transgender
    youth and is associated with better mental health among transgender
    youth who adopt a chosen name.

- abstract: "Background : The literature on trans youth has been
    dominated by etiological studies interested in trans experience as a
    medical phenomenon. An emerging body of literature has begun to
    document that trans youth are a diverse, vulnerable, yet resilient
    population, and to investigate the role of various sites of support
    such as the family, peer groups, institutions, and community spaces
    in contributing to or impeding trans youth's well-being. Method:
    This article presents the results of Stage One of interviews (n =
    24) conducted for a Community-Based Participatory Action Research
    (CBPAR) qualitative research project based in Quebec. It studies the
    factors that enhance trans youth's well-being as well as the factors
    of oppression that negatively affect it. This paper offers a brief
    overview of the anti-oppressive methodology used for this project,
    emphasizing how CBPAR was combined with Grounded Theory (GT) methods
    to encourage the direct involvement of communities and the
    translation of knowledge into action. Results: We present
    preliminary categories emerging through the ongoing axial coding
    process. These categories address trans youth's experiences in and
    perceptions of various \"sites\": 1) healthcare services both for
    gender-related and general care, 2) other institutional spaces, 3)
    the family and other social circles, and 4) community spaces.
    Conclusion: While much of this study's results support existing
    evidence on trans youth's experiences, they also provide a more
    nuanced portrayal of the complex ways in which recognition, as well
    as non-, mis-, or mal-recognition, influence trans youth's
    well-being at different sites. We also argue that recognition itself
    must be considered through the lens of intersectionality."

- abstract: Trans and non-binary youth (TNBY) face high levels of
    interpersonal and social adversity as well as disproportionate rates
    of mental health issues such as depression, self-harm and suicidal
    ideation. Among protective factors, context plays a key role. In
    addition to parental support, access to gender-affirming medical
    care begins to emerge as crucial for young people needed them. This
    paper compares, through thematic analysis, the experiences of TNBY
    with regard to access and experiences to care in Canada,
    Switzerland, England, and Australia. It identifies similarities and
    differences in barriers to access to care, as well as impacts of
    gender affirming care on young people and their well-being. The
    article concludes with a discussion on the importance of prompt and
    easier access to gender-affirming medical care, of training of
    professionals, and a hypothesis about the role of context in TNBY
    well-being.

- abstract: "Background: Canadian specialty clinics offering
    gender-affirming care to trans and gender diverse children and youth
    have observed a significant increase in referrals in recent years,
    but there is a lack of information about the experiences of young
    people receiving care. Furthermore, treatment protocols governing
    access to gender-affirming medical interventions remain a topic of
    debate.Aims: This qualitative research aims to develop a deeper
    understanding of experiences of trans youth seeking and receiving
    gender-affirming care at Canadian specialty clinics, including their
    goals in accessing care, feelings about care and medical
    interventions they have undergone, and whether they have any regrets
    about these interventions.Methods: The study uses an adapted
    Grounded Theory methodology from social determinants of health
    perspective. Thirty-five trans and gender diverse young people aged
    9 to 17 years were recruited to participate in semi-structured
    interviews through the specialty clinics where they had received or
    were waiting for gender-affirming medical interventions such as
    puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery.Results: Young people
    felt positively overall about the care they had received and the
    medical interventions they had undergone, with many recounting an
    improvement in their well-being since starting care. Most commonly
    shared frustrations concerned delays in accessing interventions due
    to clinic waiting lists or treatment protocols. Some youth described
    unwanted medication side-effects and others said they had questioned
    their transition trajectory at certain moments in the past, but none
    regretted their choice to undergo the interventions.Discussion: The
    results suggest that trans youth and gender diverse children are
    benefiting from medical gender-affirming care they receive at
    specialty clinics, providing valuable insight into their
    decision-making processes in seeking care and specific
    interventions. Providers might consider adjusting aspects of
    treatment protocols (such as age restrictions, puberty stage, or
    mental health assessments) or applying them on a more flexible,
    case-by-case basis to reduce barriers to access."

- abstract: As a traditionally underserved population that faces
    numerous health disparities, youth who identify as transgender and
    gender diverse (TGD) and their families are increasingly presenting
    to pediatric providers for education, care, and referrals. The need
    for more formal training, standardized treatment, and research on
    safety and medical outcomes often leaves providers feeling ill
    equipped to support and care for patients that identify as TGD and
    families. In this policy statement, we review relevant concepts and
    challenges and provide suggestions for pediatric providers that are
    focused on promoting the health and positive development of youth
    that identify as TGD while eliminating discrimination and stigma.

- abstract: Past studies that compare cisgender to transgender (or
    trans) and gender diverse people have found a higher prevalence of
    mental health problems among the latter groups. This article uses
    Testa's gender minority stress framework, which is an expansion of
    minority stress theory, to assess minority stressors that are
    specific to the experiences of trans and gender diverse people. The
    concept of cisnormativity, an ideology that positions cisgender
    identities as a norm, is used in relation to the gender minority
    stress framework to describe the marginalizing nature of social
    environments for trans and gender diverse people. This article
    provides a critical review that integrates and expands on past
    theoretical perspectives on gender minority stressors and protective
    factors. Specifically, this article demonstrates the relevance of
    cultural and ethnic backgrounds to complement the application of
    intersectionality in research on health disparities experienced by
    trans and gender diverse people.

- abstract: Introduction International evidence has found large mental
    health inequities among transgender people and demonstrates that
    mental health outcomes are associated with enacted stigma
    experiences and protective factors. This study aimed to examine the
    extent of associations of enacted stigma experiences specific to
    transgender people alongside protective factors with mental health
    of transgender people in Aotearoa/New Zealand.Methods The 2018
    Counting Ourselves survey was a nationwide community-based study of
    transgender people (N = 1178, Mage = 29.5) living in Aotearoa/New
    Zealand. The survey assessed a wide range of gender minority stress
    experiences and protective factors that comprised primary (support
    from friends and family) and secondary social ties (neighborhood and
    transgender community belongingness). We calculated the predicted
    probabilities that transgender people exhibit very high
    psychological distress level, non-suicidal self-injury, and suicidal
    risks with different combinations and exposure profiles of enacted
    stigma and protective factors.Results Our findings demonstrated that
    enacted stigma was associated with negative mental health, and
    support of friends and family was linked to better outcomes across
    all mental health measures. Beyond primary social ties, sense of
    belongingness to neighborhood and transgender communities were
    linked to reduced odds of psychological distress and suicidal
    ideation. For those scoring high on enacted stigma and low on
    protective factors, our model revealed a 25% probability of
    attempting suicide in the last year compared to 3% for those scoring
    low on enacted stigma and high on protective factors.Conclusions
    Echoing previous findings, this study demonstrates that transgender
    people across Aotearoa/New Zealand are less likely to manifest
    life-threatening mental health outcomes if they experience low
    levels of enacted stigma and high levels of access to protective
    factors. Our findings suggest a need to address the enacted stigma
    that transgender people face across interpersonal and structural
    settings, and also to enhance social supports that are gender
    affirmative for this population.

- abstract: The Division of Clinical Psychology (DCP) of the British
    Psychological Society (BPS) invited Professor Ken Zucker as a
    keynote speaker to their annual conference in December 2010 (BPS,
    2010). Zucker works at the Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental
    Health (CAMH) and is considered an authoritative figure in the
    controversial diagnosis and 'treatment' of children with 'Gender
    Identity Disorder' (Hill et al. 2006). He is also Chair of the
    American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Sexual and Gender Identity
    Disorders Work Group for the DSM-5 (APA, 2010). His invitation was
    proposed by the DCP conference committee 'expert group' who research
    potential speakers for the division (J. Unwin, personal
    communication, November 15, 2010). This invitation sparked an angry
    and concerned response from many. Zucker's work at the CAMH GID
    clinic has been widely criticised by academics (e.g. Wilson, 2000;
    Wren, 2002; Menvielle & Tuerk, 2002; Hird, 2003; Langer & Martin,
    2004; Lev, 2005; Bryant, 2008), organisations (e.g. Burleton, 2008;
    Choe, 2008; Queerty, 2009) and individuals concerned with LGBT
    issues and gender diversity.

    attention over the past several years in the popular media,
    political arena, and medical literature. This article reviews
    terminology in this evolving field, traditional models of gender
    identity development and their limitations, epidemiology and natural
    history of cross-gender identification among children and
    adolescents, co-occurring conditions and behaviors, research into
    the biological and psychosocial determinants of cross-gender
    identification, and research into the options regarding and benefits
    of clinical approaches to gender incongruent youth. Methods Based on
    a critical review of the extant literature, both theoretical and
    empirical, that addresses the issue of pediatric gender identity,
    the authors synthesized what is presently known and what is in need
    of further research in order to elucidate the developmental
    trajectory and clinical needs of gender diverse youth. Results The
    field of pediatric gender identity has evolved substantially over
    the past several years. New research suggests that cross-gender
    identification is prevalent (approximately 1% of youth). These youth
    suffer disproportionately high rates of anxiety, depression, and
    suicidality. Although research into the etiology of cross-gender
    identification is limited, emerging data have shown that affirmative
    treatment protocols may improve the high rates of mental health
    difficulties seen among these patients. Conclusions The field of
    pediatric gender identity has evolved dramatically. Emerging data
    suggest that these patients' high rates of anxiety, depression, and
    suicidality appear to be improved with affirmative protocols,
    although future longitudinal data are needed.

- abstract: "Purpose: We aimed to assess the Minority Stress Model which
    proposes that the stress of experiencing stigma leads to adverse
    mental health outcomes, but social supports (e.g., school and family
    connectedness) will reduce this negative effect.Methods: We measured
    stigma-related experiences, social supports, and mental health
    (self-injury, suicide, depression, and anxiety) among a sample of
    923 Canadian transgender 14- to 25-year-old adolescents and young
    adults using a bilingual online survey. Logistic regression models
    were conducted to analyze the relationship between these risk and
    protective factors and dichotomous mental health outcomes among two
    separate age groups, 14- to 18-year-old and 19- to 25-year-old
    participants.Results: Experiences of discrimination, harassment, and
    violence (enacted stigma) were positively related to mental health
    problems and social support was negatively associated with mental
    health problems in all models among both age groups. Among 14--18
    year olds, we examined school connectedness, family connectedness,
    and perception of friends caring separately, and family
    connectedness was always the strongest protective predictor in
    multivariate models. In all the mental health outcomes we examined,
    transgender youth reporting low levels of enacted stigma experiences
    and high levels of protective factors tended to report favorable
    mental health outcomes. Conversely, the majority of participants
    reporting high levels of enacted stigma and low levels of protective
    factors reported adverse mental health outcomes.Conclusion: While
    these findings are limited by nonprobability sampling procedures and
    potential additional unmeasured risk and protective factors, the
    results provide positive evidence for the Minority Stress Model in
    this population and affirm the need for policies and programs to
    support schools and families to support transgender youth."

- abstract: The transgender population has been subject to a troubled
    history of ethically and methodologically flawed research practices.
    Whilst interest and ethical standards have both risen, there remains
    little specific methodological consideration of research with
    transgender participants. This article draws on practical
    experiences of doing research with transgender communities, and
    insider group status, to construct six categories to consider when
    working on trans-focused research. These categories include the
    importance of transgender history, the assurance of transparency,
    the significance of nuanced language use, the benefits of feminist
    methodological contributions, the value of intersectionality and the
    necessity of respecting trans spaces. The article concludes by
    reflecting on the overlapping and non-exhaustive nature of these
    categories, and wider structural concerns that may trouble knowledge
    production more generally.

- abstract: The process used to locate and recruit participants in a
    qualitative study is important for controlling bias and for
    efficiently obtaining a representative sample. In complex societies
    without clearly bounded groups from which to sample, participant
    recruitment requires especially careful consideration. Yet few
    qualitative researchers discuss their recruitment methods. This
    paper describes a site-based procedure for locating, selecting, and
    recruiting participants for qualitative research for communitybased
    research in contemporary societies. An example of this procedure
    applied in a study of nutrition and health among older adults of two
    rural counties in North Carolina is presented. Additional uses for
    this procedure are discussed.

- abstract: "Purpose: Gender-affirming surgeries and hormone therapy are
    medically necessary treatments to alleviate gender dysphoria;
    however, significant gaps exist in the research and clinical
    literature on surgery utilization and age of hormone therapy
    initiation among transgender adults.Methods: We conducted a
    retrospective review of electronic health record data from a random
    sample of 201 transgender patients of ages 18--64 years who
    presented for primary care between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2015
    (inclusive) at an urban community health center in Boston, MA. Fifty
    percent in our analyses were trans masculine (TM), 50% trans
    feminine, and 24% reported a genderqueer/nonbinary gender identity.
    Regression models were fit to assess demographic, gender
    identity-related, sexual history, and mental health correlates of
    gender-affirming surgery and of age of hormone therapy
    initiation.Results: Overall, 95% of patients were prescribed
    hormones by their primary care provider, and the mean age of
    initiation of masculinizing or feminizing hormone prescriptions was
    31.8 years (SD=11.1). Younger age of initiation of hormone
    prescriptions was associated with being TM, being a student,
    identifying as straight/heterosexual, having casual sexual partners,
    and not having past alcohol use disorder. Approximately one-third
    (32%) had a documented history of gender-affirming surgery. Factors
    associated with increased odds of surgery were older age, higher
    income levels, not identifying as bisexual, and not having a current
    psychotherapist.Conclusion: This study extends our understanding of
    prevalence and factors associated with gender-affirming treatments
    among transgender adults seeking primary care. Findings can inform
    future interventions to expand delivery of clinical care for
    transgender patients."

- abstract: Despite the burgeoning scholarship on transgender health and
    health care, the literature on transgender reproduction and
    reproductive medicine remains limited. In this narrative literature
    review, we examine recently published studies focused on the
    pregnancy and birth experiences of transgender men to provide an
    overview of the literature's major contributions and illuminate the
    gaps that exist within this research. Our review reveals that
    transgender men face substantial obstacles to achieving pregnancy
    and significant challenges during pregnancy and birth, which are
    informed by institutionalized cisnormativity embedded within medical
    norms and practices. This article demonstrates the importance of
    better understanding transgender men's reproductive health care
    needs in order to improve the quality of pregnancy-related health
    care delivery to this population. Our findings also provide insight
    for researchers, health care providers, and educators seeking to
    create and enhance gender-affirming medical education and training.

- abstract: Purpose Little is known about the reproductive desires of
    transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) adolescents who may seek
    gender-affirming medical care that leads to infertility. The current
    study addressed this gap by examining attitudes toward fertility and
    family formation in a diverse sample of TGNC youth. Method An online
    survey about sexual/reproductive health in sexual and gender
    minority (SGM) adolescents ages 14--17 years was conducted from
    September to October 2016. Results A total of 156 TGNC adolescents
    (Mage = 16.1 years; 83.3% assigned female at birth; 58.3% youth of
    color) responded. Overall, 70.5% of TGNC adolescents were interested
    in adoption and 35.9% in biological parenthood; more
    gender-nonconforming youth (43.8%) than transgender youth (25.8%)
    expressed interest in biological fertility. Discussions with
    health-care providers about fertility and reproductive health were
    uncommon---only 20.5% of youth had discussed fertility in general
    and only 13.5% had discussed effects of hormones on fertility.
    However, 60.9% of respondents were interested in learning more about
    their fertility and family building options. Key themes emerging
    from qualitative comments included concerns related to
    fertility/reproductive health (e.g., stigma of SGM parenthood,
    effect of gender-affirming treatments on fertility), and the need
    for additional reproductive health information both tailored to
    their individual experience and for SGM individuals more generally.
    Discussion TGNC adolescents expressed interest in multiple family
    building options, including adoption and biological parenthood, and
    identified a need for more information about these options. Thus,
    clinicians working with adolescents should be aware of the unique
    fertility and reproductive health needs of TGNC youth.

- abstract: "Introduction Like members of any other population,
    transgender and gender variant people - individuals whose gender
    identity varies from the traditional norm or from the sex they were
    assigned at birth - often seek parenthood. Little is known about the
    decision making and experiences of these individuals, including
    male-identified and gender-variant natal females who wish to achieve
    parenthood by carrying a pregnancy. This pilot qualitative study
    used grounded theory methodology to explore the conception,
    pregnancy, and birth experiences of this population of parents.
    Methods A grounded theory methodology was used to guide data
    collection and analysis. Eight male-identified or gender-variant
    gestational parents participated in the study. Data collection
    included individual 60-minute to 90-minute interviews conducted by
    recorded online video calls, as well as a self-administered online
    demographic survey. Data were collected from September 2011 through
    May 2012. Data saturation was achieved at 6 interviews, after which
    2 more interviews were conducted. The interviews were transcribed
    verbatim, and a constant comparative method was used to analyze the
    interview transcripts. Results Loneliness was the overarching theme
    that permeated participants' experiences, social interactions, and
    emotional responses during every stage of achieving biologic
    parenthood. Within this context of loneliness, participants
    described complex internal and external processes of navigating
    identity. Navigating identity encapsulated 2 subthemes: undergoing
    internal struggles and engaging with the external world. The
    preconception period was identified as participants' time of
    greatest distress and least involvement with health care. Discussion
    The findings of this study suggest that culturally-sensitive
    preconception counseling could be beneficial for transgender and
    gender-variant individuals. The grounded theory produced by this
    pilot investigation also provides insights that will be useful to
    health care providers and others working with male-identified and
    gender-variant prospective parents."

- abstract: In this article, the authors describe how they used a hybrid
    process of inductive and deductive thematic analysis to interpret
    raw data in a doctoral study on the role of performance feedback in
    the self-assessment of nursing practice. The methodological approach
    integrated data-driven codes with theory-driven ones based on the
    tenets of social phenomenology. The authors present a detailed
    exemplar of the staged process of data coding and identification of
    themes. This process demonstrates how analysis of the raw data from
    interview transcripts and organizational documents progressed toward
    the identification of overarching themes that captured the
    phenomenon of performance feedback as described by participants in
    the study.

- abstract: Some transgender men retain their uterus, get pregnant, and
    give birth. However, societal attitudes about gender have erected
    barriers to openly being pregnant and giving birth as a transgender
    man. Little research exists regarding transgender men's reproductive
    needs. Anecdotal observations suggest that social change and
    increasing empowerment of transgender men may result in increasing
    frequency and openness about pregnancy and birth. Specific needs
    around conception, pregnancy, and newborn care may arise from
    transphobia, exogenous testosterone exposure, or from having had (or
    desiring) gender-affirming surgery. We undertook a qualitative study
    to understand the needs of transgender men who had given birth.

- abstract: "OBJECTIVE:  To conduct a cross-sectional study of
    transgender men who had been pregnant and delivered after
    transitioning from female-to-male gender to help guide practice and
    further investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  We administered a
    web-based survey from March to December 2013 to inquire about
    demographics, hormone use, fertility, pregnancy experience, and
    birth outcomes. Participants were not required to have been on
    hormone therapy to be eligible. We used a mixed-methods approach to
    evaluate the quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS:  Forty-one
    self-described transgender men completed the survey. Before
    pregnancy, 61% (n=25) had used testosterone. Mean age at conception
    was 28 years with a standard deviation of 6.8 years. Eighty-eight
    percent of oocytes (n=36) came from participants' own ovaries. Half
    of the participants received prenatal care from a physician and 78%
    delivered in a hospital. Qualitative themes included low levels of
    health care provider awareness and knowledge about the unique needs
    of pregnant transgender men as well as a desire for resources to
    support transgender men through their pregnancy. CONCLUSION: 
    Transgender men are achieving pregnancy after having socially,
    medically, or both transitioned. Themes from this study can be used
    to develop transgender-appropriate services and interventions that
    may improve the health and health care experiences of transgender
    men."

  type: book
- abstract: "Background: Transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive
    (TGE) people experience pregnancy. Quantitative data about pregnancy
    intentions and outcomes of TGE people are needed to identify
    patterns in pregnancy intentions and outcomes and to inform
    clinicians how best to provide gender-affirming and competent
    pregnancy care. Aims: We sought to collect data on pregnancy
    intentions and outcomes among TGE people assigned female or intersex
    at birth in the United States. Methods: Collaboratively with a
    study-specific community advisory team, we designed a customizable,
    online survey to measure sexual and reproductive health experiences
    among TGE people. Eligible participants included survey respondents
    who identified as a man or within the umbrella of transgender,
    nonbinary, or gender-expansive identities; were 18 years or older;
    able to complete an electronic survey in English; lived in the
    United States; and were assigned female or intersex at birth.
    Participants were recruited through The PRIDE Study - a national,
    online, longitudinal cohort study of sexual and gender minority
    people - and externally via online social media postings, TGE
    community e-mail distribution lists, in-person TGE community events,
    and academic and community conferences. We conducted descriptive
    analyses of pregnancy-related outcomes and report frequencies
    overall and by racial and ethnic identity, pregnancy intention, or
    testosterone use. Results: Out of 1,694 eligible TGE respondents who
    provided reproductive history data, 210 (12%) had been pregnant. Of
    these, 115 (55%) had one prior pregnancy, 47 (22%) had two prior
    pregnancies, and 48 (23%) had three or more prior pregnancies. Of
    the 433 pregnancies, 169 (39%) resulted in live birth, 142 (33%)
    miscarried, 92 (21%) ended in abortion, two (0.5%) ended in
    stillbirth, two (0.5%) had an ectopic pregnancy, and seven (2%) were
    still pregnant; nineteen pregnancies (4%) had an unknown outcome.
    Among live births, 39 (23%) were delivered via cesarean section.
    Across all pregnancies, 233 (54%) were unintended. Fifteen
    pregnancies occurred after initiation of testosterone, and four
    pregnancies occurred while taking testosterone. Among all
    participants, 186 (11%) wanted a future pregnancy, and 275 (16%)
    were unsure; 182 (11%) felt \\\"at risk\\\" for an unintended pregnancy.
    Discussion: TGE people in the United States plan for pregnancy,
    experience pregnancy (intended and unintended) and all pregnancy
    outcomes, and are engaged in family building. Sexual and
    reproductive health clinicians and counselors should avoid
    assumptions about pregnancy capacity or intentions based on a
    patient's presumed or stated gender or engagement with
    gender-affirming hormone therapy."

- abstract: We aim to make evident that solely referencing cisgender
    women in the context of sexual and reproductive health-particularly
    pregnancy planning and care-excludes a diverse group of transgender
    and gender nonbinary people who have sexual and reproductive health
    needs and experiences that can be similar to but also unique from
    those of cisgender women. We call on clinicians and researchers to
    ensure that all points of sexual and reproductive health access,
    research, sources of information, and care delivery comprehensively
    include and are accessible to people of all genders. We describe
    barriers to sexual and reproductive health care and research
    participation unique to people of marginalized gender identities,
    provide examples of harm resulting from these barriers, and offer
    concrete suggestions for creating inclusive, accurate, and
    respectful care and research environments-which will lead to higher
    quality health care and science for people of all genders.

- abstract: Transgender people have experienced significant advances in
    societal acceptance despite experiencing continued stigma and
    discrimination. While it can still be difficult to access quality
    health care, and there is a great deal to be done to create
    affirming health care organizations, there is growing interest
    around the United States in advancing transgender health. The focus
    of this commentary is to provide guidance to clinicians caring for
    transgender men or other gender nonconforming people who are
    contemplating, carrying, or have completed a pregnancy. Terms
    transgender and gender nonconforming specifically refer to those
    whose gender identity (e.g., being a man) differs from their female
    sex assigned at birth. Many, if not most transgender men retain
    their female reproductive organs and retain the capacity to have
    children. Review of their experience demonstrates the need for
    preconception counseling that includes discussion of stopping
    testosterone while trying to conceive and during pregnancy, and
    anticipating increasing experiences of gender dysphoria during and
    after pregnancy. The clinical aspects of delivery itself fall within
    the realm of routine obstetrical care, although further research is
    needed into how mode and environment of delivery may affect gender
    dysphoria. Postpartum considerations include discussion of options
    for chest (breast) feeding, and how and when to reinitiate
    testosterone. A positive perinatal experience begins from the moment
    transgender men first present for care and depends on comprehensive
    affirmation of gender diversity.

  title: Qualitative Evaluation and Research Methods
  type: book
- abstract: A growing body of literature supports stigma and
    discrimination as fundamental causes of health disparities. Stigma
    and discrimination experienced by transgender people have been
    associated with increased risk for depression, suicide, and HIV.
    Transgender stigma and discrimination experienced in health care
    influence transgender people's health care access and utilization.
    Thus, understanding how stigma and discrimination manifest and
    function in health care encounters is critical to addressing health
    disparities for transgender people. A qualitative, grounded theory
    approach was taken to this study of stigma in health care
    interactions. Between January and July 2011, fifty-five transgender
    people and twelve medical providers participated in one-time
    in-depth interviews about stigma, discrimination, and health care
    interactions between providers and transgender patients. Due to the
    social and institutional stigma against transgender people, their
    care is excluded from medical training. Therefore, providers
    approach medical encounters with transgender patients with
    ambivalence and uncertainty. Transgender people anticipate that
    providers will not know how to meet their needs. This uncertainty
    and ambivalence in the medical encounter upsets the normal balance
    of power in provider-patient relationships. Interpersonal stigma
    functions to reinforce the power and authority of the medical
    provider during these interactions. Functional theories of stigma
    posit that we hold stigmatizing attitudes because they serve
    specific psychological functions. However, these theories ignore how
    hierarchies of power in social relationships serve to maintain and
    reinforce inequalities. The findings of this study suggest that
    interpersonal stigma also functions to reinforce medical power and
    authority in the face of provider uncertainty. Within functional
    theories of stigma, it is important to acknowledge the role of power
    and to understand how stigmatizing attitudes function to maintain
    systems of inequality that contribute to health disparities.

- abstract: "Background: Transgender stigma is rampant within healthcare
    systems in the United States. Transgender adults assigned female at
    birth -- including those identifying as transmasculine or non-binary
    -- face unique barriers, such as stigma when accessing sexual and
    reproductive healthcare labeled as being for \"women.\" However,
    transgender and non-binary people are not passive victims to this
    stigma, and the medical community would benefit from understanding
    the actions this population takes to resist and reduce transgender
    stigma in healthcare. Yet, little research has attempted to
    understand such actions.Aims: This qualitative study aims to explore
    how transmasculine and non-binary adults are actively resisting and
    reducing the impact of transgender stigma in healthcare.Methods:
    In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25
    transmasculine and non-binary adults assigned female at birth who
    were living in a metropolitan area in the mid-Atlantic United
    States. The research team analyzed qualitative interview data using
    content analysis.Results: The 25 participants ranged in age from 21
    to 57, with an average age of 33 years old. Six themes were
    identified related to resisting and reducing transgender stigma in
    healthcare: (a) using social support; (b) persistence to meet one's
    own needs; (c) avoiding mainstream healthcare; (d) advocacy; (e)
    doing one's own research; and (f) strategic disclosure of
    transgender/non-binary identity. We detail how privilege and
    intersectionality connect to the use of these strategies.Discussion:
    Findings indicate there is value in using peer advocates and peer
    health literacy; in developing and nurturing support groups related
    to transgender/non-binary health; in developing \"allies\" employed
    within the healthcare system; in creating and maintaining lists of
    culturally responsive health providers and resources about
    navigating the healthcare system; and in offering trainings related
    to self-advocacy and health-related activism. These findings can be
    used to inform future health prevention and intervention efforts
    with transmasculine and non-binary adults."

- abstract: "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify factors associated
    with the reproductive planning of trans-masculine adults. STUDY
    DESIGN: Between 2015 and 2016, providers enrolled 150
    trans-masculine adults in a sexual health study assessing
    sociodemographics, social support, gender affirmation, sexual
    partnering, and reproductive history and planning. A brief clinical
    interview assessed contraceptive use and concerns. Bivariate and
    multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations
    between participant characteristics and three outcomes: current
    contraceptive use, lifetime pregnancy history and reproductive
    planning. RESULTS: Overall, 37.3% are currently using
    contraceptives; 5.3% have been pregnant; and 20.0% plan to have
    biological children (9.3% plan to become pregnant; 12.0% plan to use
    their oocytes with a surrogate). Participants are less likely to use
    contraceptives if they are students vs. not, have socially affirmed
    their gender vs. not and have a partner vs. are single. Greater
    number of sexual partners is associated with the increased odds of
    contraceptive use. Further, as social support increases, the odds of
    having been pregnant decreases. Participants with a nonbinary gender
    identity are more likely to want to become pregnant than those with
    a binary gender identity, whereas those who have socially affirmed
    their gender are less likely to want to become pregnant than those
    who had not. Finally, participants of color more commonly planned to
    use their oocytes with a surrogate than white participants.
    CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic, gender affirmation, social support and
    sexual partner factors are associated with contraceptive use and
    reproductive history among trans-masculine patients. IMPLICATIONS:
    Healthcare providers must be aware of the diverse reproductive
    histories and pregnancy goals of trans-masculine individuals in
    order to provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare counseling
    and provision. More research is needed to better understand
    contraception and reproduction desires in trans-masculine
    individuals."

- abstract: Gender affirming medical and surgical treatments affect the
    reproductive potential of transgender individuals. Prior to the
    development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), genital
    gender-affirming surgery frequently eliminated a patient's
    reproductive potential. Today, all patients should be counseled on
    their fertility preservation (FP) options before medical and
    surgical transition, yet this appears to seldom occur in practice.
    The following review is the result of a systematic literature search
    of PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar to identify current and future
    FP options, barriers to treatment patients face, practice patterns
    of transgender health care providers, and if there were any
    standardized counseling protocols. Options for transwomen at any
    point in their transition range from simply providing a semen sample
    to be used with assistive reproductive techniques to experimental
    techniques involving testicular cryopreservation followed by in
    vitro initiation of spermatogenesis. Transmen before and after
    starting hormone therapy can pursue any assistive reproductive
    techniques available for ciswomen. Future options currently under
    investigation include ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) with in
    vitro oocyte maturation. In addition to counseling about their FP
    options, patients should be advised prospectively about the
    requirements, process details, the total costs associated with
    achieving pregnancy, and the inherent risks associated with using
    preserved genetic material including risk of failure, and maternal
    and fetal health risks. Transgender patients report using assistive
    reproductive services difficult, due to a lack of dialogue about
    fertility and the lack of information offered to them- presumably
    because their circumstances do not fit into a traditional narrative
    familiar to providers. Physicians and health care providers would
    benefit from better educational tools to help transgender patients
    make informed decisions and better training about transgender
    patients in general, and FP options available to them.

- abstract: "Background: Medical school and residency curricula are
    lacking in content on the care of the transgender patient. As a
    result, many providers do not have enough experience and knowledge
    to adequately care for this patient population. The aim of this
    study was to assess gynecologists' preferences and knowledge base
    with regard to transgender healthcare.Methods: This was a
    cross-sectional survey of obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN)
    providers. An anonymous survey was sent via electronic mail to nine
    academic OBGYN departments across the United States. Survey
    questions were designed to assess provider experience and practice
    environment, education about transgender health practices, personal
    experience with transgender patients, and knowledge base regarding
    current recommendations for the care of gender minority
    patients.Results: Of the 352 providers who received the survey, 141
    responded, for a 40.1% response rate. Of the respondents, 61.7% (87
    of 141) were generalist OBGYNs, and 86% (117 of 136) practiced in an
    academic institution; 80% (113 of 141) did not receive training in
    residency on the care of transgender patients. Time in practice was
    not associated with having learned about transgender care. Only
    35.3% and 29% were comfortable caring for male-to-female and
    female-to-male transsexual patients, respectively; and, 88.7% and
    80.4% were willing to perform screening Pap smears on female-to-male
    transsexual patients and routine breast examinations on
    male-to-female patients, respectively. Eighty-two of 138 providers
    (59.4%) did not know the recommendations for breast cancer screening
    in male-to-female patients.Conclusions: Efforts should be made to
    educate trainees on the important aspects of transgender care, and
    comprehensive guidelines should be published for practicing
    providers."

- abstract: "BACKGROUND: Hormonal therapy and sex reassignment surgery
    (SRS) in transsexual persons lead to an irreversible loss of their
    reproductive potential. The current and future technologies could
    create the possibility for female-to-male transsexual persons
    (transsexual men) to have genetically related children. However,
    little is known about this topic. The aim of this study is to
    provide information on the reproductive wishes of transsexual men
    after SRS. METHODS A self-constructed questionnaire was presented to
    50 transsexual men in a single-center study. RESULTS: The majority
    (64%) of transsexual men were currently involved in a relationship.
    Eleven participants (22.0%) reported having children. For eight
    participants, their female partner was inseminated with donor sperm,
    whereas three participants gave birth before hormonal therapy and
    SRS. At the time of interview, more than half of the participants
    desired to have children (54%). There were 18 participants (37.5%)
    who reported that they had considered freezing their germ cells, if
    this technique would have been available previously. Participants
    without children at the time of investigation expressed this desire
    more often than participants with children (χ²; test: P= 0.006).
    CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that the majority of transsexual men
    desire to have children. Therefore, more attention should be paid to
    this topic during the diagnostic phase of transition and to the
    consequences for genetic parenthood after starting sex reassignment
    therapy."

- abstract: The Standards of Care (SOC) for the Health of Transsexual,
    Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People is a publication of the
    World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). The
    overall goal of the SOC is to provide clinical guidance for health
    professionals to assist transsexual, transgender, and gender
    nonconforming people with safe and effective pathways to achieving
    lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves, in order to
    maximize their overall health, psychological well-being, and
    self-fulfillment. This assistance may include primary care,
    gynecologic and urologic care, reproductive options, voice and
    communication therapy, mental health services (e.g., assessment,
    counseling, psychotherapy), and hormonal and surgical treatments.
    The SOC are based on the best available science and expert
    professional consensus. Because most of the research and experience
    in this field comes from a North American and Western European
    perspective, adaptations of the SOC to other parts of the world are
    necessary. The SOC articulate standards of care while acknowledging
    the role of making informed choices and the value of harm reduction
    approaches. In addition, this version of the SOC recognizes that
    treatment for gender dysphoria i.e., discomfort or distress that is
    caused by a discrepancy between persons gender identity and that
    persons sex assigned at birth (and the associated gender role and/or
    primary and secondary sex characteristics) has become more
    individualized. Some individuals who present for care will have made
    significant self-directed progress towards gender role changes or
    other resolutions regarding their gender identity or gender
    dysphoria. Other individuals will require more intensive services.
    Health professionals can use the SOC to help patients consider the
    full range of health services open to them, in accordance with their
    clinical needs and goals for gender expression.

- abstract: Although informed consent models for prescribing hormone
    replacement therapy are becoming increasingly prevalent, many
    physicians continue to require an assessment and referral letter
    from a mental health professional prior to prescription. Drawing on
    personal and communal experience, the author argues that assessment
    and referral requirements are dehumanising and unethical,
    foregrounding the ways in which these requirements evidence a
    mistrust of trans people, suppress the diversity of their
    experiences and sustain an unjustified double standard in contrast
    to other forms of clinical care. Physicians should abandon this
    unethical requirement in favour of an informed consent approach to
    transgender care.

- abstract: "Background Gender euphoria is an important experience and
    concept for many, especially transgender and/or nonbinary
    individuals, but has not received much attention from psychological
    and clinical research. In contrast to gender dysphoria, which
    originates in psychiatry, the term \"gender euphoria\" has been
    mobilized by some LGBTQ people to describe the powerfully positive
    emotions that can come from one's gender/sex. As such, researchers
    and clinicians may benefit from conceptual clarity as to what gender
    euphoria is and what kinds of experiences might result in gender
    euphoria.Aim We aimed to better understand how trans community
    members and others conceptualize the term \"gender euphoria,\"
    including its relationship to gender dysphoria, as well as the
    contexts and behaviors that elicit gender euphoria.Method We
    administered an online qualitative survey to participants (N = 47)
    of diverse sexualities and gender/sexes (including transgender,
    cisgender, and/or nonbinary participants) who had heard of or used
    the term \"gender euphoria.\" Participants answered open-ended
    questions about where they had heard the term being used, how they
    would define gender euphoria and gender dysphoria, the relation
    between these terms, and their gender euphoric experiences.Results
    Analyses resulted in five themes: (1) gender euphoria describes a
    joyful feeling of rightness in one's gender/sex, (2) gender euphoric
    experiences can be external, internal, and/or social, (3) \"gender
    euphoria\" originated in and circulates in online and in-person
    gender/sex minority communities, (4) dysphoria describes a negative
    feeling of conflict between gender/sexed aspects of one's self, and
    (5) the relationship between euphoria and dysphoria is
    complex.Discussion These results can inform qualitative and
    quantitative research, gender affirmative clinical practice,
    political fights for transgender rights, and understandings of
    gendered experiences for people of all identities."

- abstract: Purpose Hair removal procedures, including electrolysis and
    laser hair removal, are the most commonly pursued gender-affirmative
    medical interventions by transfeminine people, but previous
    empirical studies have not examined their relationship to
    psychological well-being. Materials and Methods Participants were
    281 transfeminine adults in the United States who responded to an
    online questionnaire. Results Satisfaction with one's current state
    of hair removal was negatively correlated with situational body
    image dysphoria, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and negative
    affect, and positively correlated with positive affect. Conclusions
    Results of this study suggest that hair removal is associated with
    both decreased distress but also increased subjective well-being
    (e.g. higher positive affect). Though the construct of 'gender
    euphoria' has been introduced in previous publications, it has thus
    far not been rigorously defined or operationalized within health
    research. These results suggest that gender euphoria can be
    understood in terms of increased subjective well-being associated
    with gender affirmation, including gender-affirmative medical
    interventions. This study demonstrates a significant association
    between hair removal services and depression symptoms, anxiety
    symptoms, situational body image dysphoria, positive affect, and
    negative affect in transfeminine adults. These findings cast
    significant doubt on the assertion that hair removal services for
    transfeminine people are 'cosmetic.'

- abstract: Gender dysphoria is distress due to a discrepancy between
    one's assigned gender and gender identity. Adults who wish to access
    gender clinics are assessed to ensure they meet the diagnostic
    criteria for gender dysphoria. Therefore, the definition of gender
    dysphoria has a significant impact on the lives of individuals who
    wish to undergo physical gender transition. This systematic review
    aimed to identify and synthesize all existing qualitative research
    literature about the lived experience of gender dysphoria in adults.
    A pre-planned systematic search identified 1491 papers, with 20 of
    those meeting full inclusion criteria, and a quality assessment of
    each paper was conducted. Data pertaining to the lived experience of
    gender dysphoria were extracted from each paper and a
    meta-ethnographic synthesis was conducted. Four overarching concepts
    were identified; distress due to dissonance of assigned and
    experienced gender; interface of assigned gender, gender identity
    and society; social consequences of gender identity; internal
    processing of rejection, and transphobia. A key finding was the
    reciprocal relationship between an individual's feelings about their
    gender and societal responses to transgender people. Other subthemes
    contributing to distress were misgendering, mismatch between gender
    identity and societal expectations, and hypervigilance for
    transphobia.

- abstract: In the DSM-5, there has been a change in the diagnosis for
    transpeople of all ages from Gender Identity Disorder (GID) to
    Gender Dysphoria (GD), in part to better indicate the distress that
    transpeople may experience when their gender identity feels
    incongruent. The Workgroup for Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders,
    chaired by Kenneth J. Zucker, was employed by the American
    Psychiatric Association (APA) to update the DSM-5's GID diagnosis
    reflecting contemporary scientific knowledge. Additionally, in a
    pre-publication report to the APA, members of the Workgroup
    suggested that they would also be concerned with the
    destigmatization of transpeople while preserving a diagnosis that
    medical insurance companies would accept for issuing payments for
    transitioning treatments (Drescher, 2013). The aims of this article
    are, firstly, to question whether changing the diagnosis lessens the
    stigmatization of transpeople. I will suggest that the semantic
    change from GID to GD marks "inverted" gendered expressions as
    pathological and, thus, continues to stigmatize transpeople.
    Secondly, the article explores the development of the GD diagnosis,
    and illustrates how the scientific data this were founded on are
    contentious. The article then demonstrates how the trans
    anti-pathologization movement has challenged the perceived
    pathologizing effects of the DSM-5 classification of GD. The article
    examines a selection of Western transgender community advocates'
    websites, forums, and blogs. From these sources, the article then
    explores the different narratives of transpeople and political
    groups who offer details of their praxis, and evidences how the
    trans anti-pathologization advocates use the available science and
    human rights discourses to contest the role of psychiatry in the
    treatment of transpeople.

- abstract: "Background: Transgender microaffirmations are subtle
    endorsements of a person's gender identity through both verbal
    acknowledgements and behavioral gestures. Microaffirmations
    positively impact individuals who identify as transgender by
    acknowledging their gender identity and by communicating a sense of
    support and validation.Aims: This study focuses on microaffirmations
    specifically directed toward nonbinary transgender individuals
    within romantic relationships.Methods: Participants included 161
    adults who identified as nonbinary: 85 who identified as gender
    nonconforming and 76 who identified as agender. These participants
    were either currently in a romantic relationship or had been in a
    romantic relationship within the past 5 years. Participants
    completed an online survey and provided examples of the
    microaffirmations they experienced from their romantic
    partners.Results: Responses were analyzed via thematic analysis,
    resulting in four overarching themes: (1) Identity Validations,
    acknowledgement and acceptance of nonbinary identity; (2) Identity
    Endorsements, active endorsements of nonbinary through language or
    behavior; (3) Active Learning, self-education about nonbinary
    identities; and (4) Active Defense, interruptions of others'
    negative actions directed at nonbinary partners.Discussion:
    Discussion of the results focuses on understanding how
    microaffirmations operate to complicate binary notions of gender/sex
    and positively influence nonbinary transgender individuals in
    interpersonal relationships."

- abstract: "The present study aimed to expand current understandings of
    gender dysphoria by explicating the social context in which it is
    experienced and by centering the analysis on the lived experience of
    trans individuals. Data were collected online from a nonclinical
    sample composed of 610 transgender participants. Participants
    answered 2 open-ended prompts to describe their gender dysphoria as
    experienced in a social context. Thematic analysis was used to code
    the data and determine main themes. Four socially salient themes
    emerged regarding gender dysphoria: 1) External Triggers; 2)
    Internal Processing; 3) Interruption of Social Functioning; and 4)
    Moderated by Transition. When describing their experiences,
    participants identified external triggers for dysphoria that were
    social in nature as well as internal processes that occurred in
    response to those triggers. Often this led to an interruption of
    social functioning. For some of our participants, gender dysphoria
    was moderated by transition. Results of the present study suggest
    that trans individuals' experience of gender dysphoria is greatly
    impacted by social context. Discussion focuses on the way the
    present findings may be best understood in relation to the
    literature on minority stress. Consideration of gender dysphoria as
    a proximal stressor may help to conceptually disaggregate gender
    dysphoria from psychological stress in the way we frame mental
    health considerations for trans individuals. (PsycInfo Database

- abstract: High prevalence of psychological distress, including greater
    depression, lower self-esteem, and suicidal ideation, has been
    documented across numerous samples of transgender women and has been
    attributed to high rates of discrimination and violence. According
    to the gender affirmation framework (Sevelius, 2013), access to
    sources of gender-affirmative support can offset such negative
    psychological effects of social oppression. However, critical
    questions remain unanswered in regards to how and which aspects of
    gender affirmation are related to psychological well-being. The aims
    of this study were to investigate the associations among 3 discrete
    areas of gender affirmation (psychological, medical, and social) and
    participants' reports of psychological well-being. A community
    sample of 573 transgender women with a history of sex work completed
    a 1-time self-report survey that assessed demographic
    characteristics, gender affirmation, and mental health outcomes. In
    multivariate models, we found that social, psychological, and
    medical gender affirmation were significant predictors of lower
    depression and higher self-esteem whereas no domains of affirmation
    were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Findings
    support the need for accessible and affordable transitioning
    resources for transgender women to promote better quality of life
    among an already vulnerable population. However, transgender
    individuals should not be portrayed simplistically as objects of
    vulnerability, and research identifying mechanisms to promote
    wellness and thriving is necessary for future intervention
    development. As the gender affirmation framework posits, the
    personal experience of feeling affirmed as a transgender person
    results from individuals' subjective perceptions of need along
    multiple dimensions of gender affirmation. Thus, personalized
    assessment of gender affirmation may be a useful component of
    counseling and service provision for transgender women. (PsycInfo

- abstract: A dearth of research has explored concurrently the
    associations between multiple forms of gender affirmation (or
    transitioning) and the mental health of transgender adults. In 2015,
    288 U.S. transgender adults completed a cross-sectional, online
    survey assessing demographics, gender affirmation experiences, and
    mental health. Adjusting for age and discrimination experiences, we
    used mixed-effect logistic regression analyses to examine changes in
    self-reported suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and non-suicidal
    self-injury (NSSI) before and after initiating the gender
    affirmation process, and linear regression analyses to examine
    associations between gender affirmation experiences and
    self-reported depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Overall,
    81.3% of participants identified along the female-to-male, trans
    masculine gender spectrum (of which 20.9% identified as non-binary)
    and 18.8% identified along the male-to-female, trans feminine gender
    spectrum (of which 7.4% identified as non-binary). Nearly all
    participants (98.6%) reported disclosing their gender identity to
    family or a coworker; 67.4% endorsed recently using hormones, and
    31.3% endorsed a gender-affirming medical procedure. In
    multivariable models, participants were at greater odds of NSSI,
    contemplating suicide, and attempting suicide before initiating the
    gender affirmation process compared to after. In additional models,
    gender identity disclosure and medical procedure engagement were
    inversely associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, whereas
    gender identity disclosure, hormone use, and medical procedure
    engagement were inversely associated with stress symptoms. Finally,
    the number of gender affirmation experiences endorsed was inversely
    associated with depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Findings
    support the possibility that social and medical gender affirmation
    experiences may be protective against mental health problems in
    transgender adults.

- abstract: The medicalization of gender variance is a key force in
    transgender people's experiences of embodiment, identity, and
    community. While most directly dictating experiences of diagnosis
    and medical classification, it is important to acknowledge that the
    effects of medicalization are widespread across social contexts and
    institutions. I explore the medical model of transgender identity,
    with special attention to its current diagnostic classification, in
    order to highlight how transgender people's interactional
    experiences of gender are shaped by medical authority. I review
    literature that highlights the operation of the medical model as a
    normative accountability structure in its influence across multiple
    institutions of social life including health and healthcare,
    transgender community groups, and legal classification.

- abstract: While prior research has called attention to how medically
    based, normative understandings of sex and gender place undue
    restrictions on transgender people's autonomy, there has yet to be
    an attempt to consolidate this research into a recognizable concept
    that is situated within existing theoretical frameworks. This
    article uses documentary films focused on transgender men as an
    empirical example to develop the concept of transnormativity.
    Transnormativity describes the specific framework to which
    transgender people's presentations and experiences of gender are
    held accountable. Drawing on research specific to transgender
    community groups, medicalization, and legal transition, I argue that
    transnormativity structures transgender experience, identification,
    and narratives into a hierarchy of legitimacy that is dependent upon
    medical standards. This ideology, as I show via a content analysis
    of documentary films, circulates in media depictions of transgender
    people in ways that eclipse alternative explanations of gender
    non-conformity. While medical transition is a central component of
    many transgender people's gender trajectory, I argue in this article
    that the privileging of the medical model over others creates a
    marginalizing effect for gender-non-conforming people who cannot or
    do not wish to medically transition.

- abstract: Transgender individuals face severe stigma-driven health
    inequities structurally, institutionally, and interpersonally,
    yielding poor individual-level outcomes. Gender affirmation, or
    being recognized based on one's gender identity, expression, and/or
    role, may be considered a manifestation of resilience. To provide
    intervention and policy guidelines, we examined latent constructs
    representative of gender affirmation (legal documentation changes,
    transition-related medical procedures, familial support) and
    discrimination (unequal treatment, harassment, and attacks), and
    tested their impact on mental, physical, and behavioral health
    outcomes among 17,188 binary-identified transgender participants in
    the 2015 US Transgender Survey. Confirmatory factor analyses
    revealed high standardized factor loadings for both latent
    variables, on which we regressed outcomes using structural equation
    modeling. Fit indices suggested good model fit. Affirmation was
    associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation and psychological
    distress, and higher odds of substance use, and past-year healthcare
    use and HIV-testing. Discrimination was associated with higher odds
    of suicidal ideation, psychological distress, substance use, and
    past-year HIV-testing. Affirmation and discrimination interaction
    analyses showed lower odds of past-year suicidal ideation, with
    affirmation having a significant moderating protective effect
    against discrimination. Gender affirmation is paramount in upholding
    transgender health. Clarification of affirmation procedures, and
    increases in its accessibility, equitably across racial/ethnic
    groups, should become a priority, from policy to the family unit.
    The impact of discrimination demands continued advocacy via
    education and policy.

- abstract: The minority stress model describes the unique stressors
    that impact sexual and gender minorities above and beyond general
    stressors and includes both external (distal) and internal
    (proximal) sources of stress. Proximal stressors are the thoughts
    and feelings that are elicited and maintained because of direct and
    indirect experiences with prejudice events and are typically
    conceptualized to include anticipated stigma, internalized
    transphobia, and gender identity concealment. Recently, gender
    dysphoria has been proposed as a proximal stressor due to its
    interactive nature with both external triggers and mental health
    symptoms. However, gender dysphoria has not been tested empirically
    in prior published models of gender minority stress. Trans and
    nonbinary participants (N = 297) over the age of 18 were recruited
    via postings on social networking websites. Participants identified
    as trans feminine (n = 128), trans masculine (n = 110), nonbinary (n
    = 49), and agender (n = 10), and ranged in age from 18 to 67 (M =
    28, SD = 9.42). Through a confirmatory factor analysis, it was shown
    that internalized transphobia, anticipated stress, gender identity
    concealment, and gender dysphoria reflect the latent factor proximal
    stress. Findings from this study suggest that gender dysphoria
    should be understood as a proximal stressor. As such, clinical
    interventions that target how individuals internalize experiences in
    a cisnormative society could have a positive impact on the severity
    of gender dysphoria. Additionally, modeling gender dysphoria as a
    proximal stressor can help future research disaggregate gender
    dysphoria from negative mental health symptoms such as anxiety or
    rumination. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights

- abstract: "Microaffirmations are small, interpersonal interactions
    that communicate validation for an identity. The present study
    focuses on transgender microaffirmations received from romantic
    partners. Participants included 339 self-identified transgender
    adults in a romantic relationship (currently or within the past 5
    years). Participants were recruited via social media and snowball
    sampling and took an online survey detailing their experiences in
    romantic relationships. Participant responses were analyzed via
    thematic analysis, resulting in seven relationship-salient themes:
    (1) acknowledging and using cisgender privilege, (2) centering on
    partner's identity, (3) affirming gender(less) presentation, (4)
    helping partner process identity, (5) seeking permission, (6) using
    affirming language, and (7) acknowledging milestones. Findings
    emphasize the importance of positive aspects of romantic
    relationships. Implications for working with transgender clients are
    discussed."

- abstract: "Researchers currently lack a reliable and valid means of
    assessing minority stress and resilience factors in transgender and
    gender-nonconforming (TGNC) people. This study was conducted to
    develop and evaluate the validity of a tool to better assess these
    constructs in TGNC populations. The Gender Minority Stress and
    Resilience (GMSR) measure was developed grounded on Meyer's minority
    stress model, and adjusted to reflect the experiences of TGNC
    populations based on TGNC literature and archival data from TGNC
    focus groups. The final GMSR includes scales assessing 9 constructs:
    gender-related discrimination, gender-related rejection,
    gender-related victimization, nonaffirmation of gender identity,
    internalized transphobia, negative expectations for future events,
    nondisclosure, community connectedness, and pride. In the current
    study, 844 participants completed the GMSR measure as well as
    measures related to mental health, general life stress, and social
    support. Results indicated good model fit, criterion validity,
    convergent validity, and discriminant validity for the 9
    hypothesized scales. Discriminant validity for the scales were also
    partially supported. Overall, the current study offers preliminary
    evidence of the reliability and validity of the GMSR Measure for use
    with TGNC populations. The GMSR Measure has several uses for both
    research and clinical purposes, including increasing understanding
    of the experiences and correlates of gender minority stress and
    resilience factors and assessing whether specific therapies or
    interventions are helpful in reducing risk and supporting resilience
    in TGNC populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

- abstract: Transgender people have long been associated with sexual
    perversion. For example, many early versions of the Diagnostic and
    Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) infamously categorized
    any gender variance as sexual deviance or paraphilia. This article
    therefore investigates the taxonomical movement away from the
    transgender subject as perverse toward the current diagnosis of
    gender dysphoria, which instead consolidates the transgender subject
    as distressed and suffering. Through an unconventional use of
    psychoanalytic theories of perversion, I argue that DSM-5's new
    diagnosis criteria work defensively, functioning as an antidote to
    the clinician's anxiety in the face of difference. When separated
    from stereotypical acts and identities, perversion proves to be
    quite valuable in understanding clinical transphobia. In particular,
    Freud's writings on fetishism and disavowal reveal some of the
    unconscious roles at play in the repeated medicalization of trans
    people and the restricting of transition-related resources. Through
    the donning of a fetish object, disavowal acts to ignore an
    upsetting reality while the traumatic truth remains intact. An
    analysis of Chase Joynt's video installation, Resisterectomy,
    provides grounded narratives of gendered surgery and illness that
    disrupt anticipated affects, temporalities, and curative measures.

- abstract: Social justice pedagogy appeals to experience as a form of
    empowerment and as a starting‐point for working collaboratively in
    the diverse classroom. However, taking experience as unmediated and
    as an authoritative source of knowledge can function in ways that
    are counterproductive to the aims of social justice education. This
    essay examines the presumed authority of experience through a
    discussion of a debate around the meaning of 'experience' in
    feminist thought. Social justice educators, the author argues, must
    focus attention on how the subjective understanding of experience is
    mediated by politics, power and ideology.

- abstract: "This book is aimed at engineering academics worldwide, who
    are attempting to bring social justice into their work and practice,
    or who would like to but don't know where to start. This is the
    first book dedicated specifically to University professionals on
    Engineering and Social Justice, an emerging and exciting area of
    research and practice. An international team of multidisciplinary
    authors share their insights and invite and inspire us to
    reformulate the way we work. Each chapter is based on research and
    yet presents the outcomes of scholarly studies in a user oriented
    style. We look at all three areas of an engineering academic's
    professional role: research, teaching and community engagement. Some
    of our team have created classes which help students think through
    their role as engineering practitioners in society. Others are
    focusing their research on outcomes that are socially just and for
    client groups who are marginalized and powerless. Yet others are
    consciously engaging local community groups and exploring ways in
    which the University might 'serve' communities at home and globally
    from a post-development perspective. We are additionally concerned
    with the student cohort and who has access to engineering studies.
    We take a broad social and ecological justice perspective to
    critique existing and explore alternative practices. This book is a
    handbook for any engineering academic, who wishes to develop
    engineering graduates as well as technologies and practices that are
    non-oppressive, equitable and engaged. It is also an essential
    reader for anyone studying in this interdisciplinary juncture of
    social science and engineering. Scholars using a critical
    theoretical lens on engineering practice and education, from Science
    and Technology Studies, History and Philosophy of Engineering,
    Engineering and Science Education will find this text invaluable."

- abstract: Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely
    acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within
    psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and
    theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We
    outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other
    qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and
    in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions.
    We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic
    analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and
    consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis.
    Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic
    analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful
    and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond
    psychology.

    the result of being 'too white.' California high school students who
    embrace one such white identity, nerds, employ a superstandard
    language variety to reject the youth culture norm of coolness. These
    practices also ideologically position nerds as hyperwhite by
    distancing them from the African American underpinnings of European
    American youth culture.

- abstract: "Informed by ethnographic work with transgender individuals
    and communities in the Midwest and San Francisco, this article
    explores the relationship between technology and transgender
    identity. It examines the possibilities for self-recognition that
    transgender audiences had before the era of the internet. Then,
    through a case study of a transgender person, it engages in a close
    analysis of what it means to transition gender in online
    environments. Drawing from Heidegger's (1962. Being and time. New
    York: Harper Perennial) phenomenology of technology, I argue that
    technology has become increasingly \"ready-to-hand\"---available,
    participatory, and taken-for-granted---for transgender individuals.
    In particular, the internet has created virtual \"counterpublics\"
    (Warner, 2002. Publics and counterpublics. Brooklyn: Zone Books)
    that furnish feelings of belonging and ideological affiliation, as
    well as \"care structures\" (Scannell, 2014. Television and the
    meaning of live: An enquiry into the human situation. Cambridge, UK:
    Polity Press), architectures of organized care and concern, that
    facilitate transgender identity work and everyday survival. For
    transgender individuals, who live in a world created without them in
    mind, the affordances of online counterpublics and care structures
    help them manage the trials and complexities of everyday life. At
    the same time, contemporary digital media environments introduce new
    risks and liabilities for transgender individuals."

  type: chapter
- abstract: While much is known about the experiences of women and
    racial/ethnic minorities in male-dominated fields such as
    engineering, the experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)
    identifying individuals remain unstudied. Our article breaks this
    silence with an exploratory study of the ways LGB students at a
    major research university in the western United States both
    experience and navigate the climate of their engineering college.
    Based on interviews and focus groups, we find that both pervasive
    prejudicial cultural norms and perceptions of competence particular
    to the engineering profession can limit these students'
    opportunities to succeed, relative to their heterosexual peers.
    Nevertheless, through coping strategies which can require immense
    amounts of additional emotional and academic effort, LGB students
    navigate a chilly and heteronormative engineering climate by
    'passing' as heterosexual, 'covering' or downplaying cultural
    characteristics associated with LGB identities, and garnering
    expertise to make themselves indispensable to others. These
    additional work burdens are often accompanied by academic and social
    isolation, making engineering school a hostile place for many LGB
    identifying students. This research provides an opportunity to
    theorize categories of inequality within engineering that do not
    have visible markers, and to consider them within a broader
    framework of intersectionality.

- abstract: Objectives. To determine how sensitive estimates of lesbian,
    gay, bisexual, or questioning (LGBQ)--heterosexual youth health
    disparities are to the presence of potentially mischievous
    responders.Methods. We used US data from the 2015 Youth Risk
    Behavior Survey, pooled across jurisdictions that included a
    question about sexual identity for a total sample of 148 960
    students. We used boosted regressions (a machine-learning technique)
    to identify unusual patterns of responses to 7 screener items
    presumably unrelated to LGBQ identification, which generated an
    index of suspected mischievousness. We estimated LGBQ--heterosexual
    youth disparities on 20 health outcomes; then we removed 1% of
    suspected mischievous responders at a time and re-estimated
    disparities to assess the robustness of original estimates.Results.
    Accounting for suspected mischievousness reduced estimates of the
    average LGBQ--heterosexual youth health disparity by up to 46% for
    boys and 23% for girls; however, screening did not affect all
    outcomes equally. Drug- and alcohol-related disparities were most
    affected, particularly among boys, but bullying and suicidal
    ideation were unaffected.Conclusions. Including screener items in
    public health data sets and performing rigorous sensitivity analyses
    can support the validity of youth health estimates.

    Estimates of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Questioning
    (LGBQ)--Heterosexual Youth Health Disparities
  type: article-journal
  url: "https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304407"
  volume: 108
- abstract: Although numerous survey-based studies have found that
    students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning
    (LGBQ) have elevated risk for many negative academic, disciplinary,
    psychological, and health outcomes, the validity of the types of
    data on which these results rest have come under increased scrutiny.
    Over the past several years, a variety of data-validity screening
    techniques have been used in attempts to scrub data sets of
    "mischievous responders," youth who systematically provide extreme
    and untrue responses to outcome items and who tend to falsely report
    being LGBQ. We conducted a preregistered replication of Cimpian et
    al. with the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey to (1) estimate new
    LGBQ-heterosexual disparities on 20 outcomes; (2) test a broader,
    mechanistic theory relating mischievousness effects with a feature
    of items (i.e., item response-option extremity); and (3) compare
    four techniques used to address mischievous responders. Our results
    are consistent with Cimpian et al.'s findings that potentially
    mischievous responders inflate LGBQ-heterosexual disparities, do so
    more among boys than girls, and affect outcomes differentially. For
    example, we find that removing students suspected of being
    mischievous responders can cut male LGBQ-heterosexual disparities in
    half overall and can completely or mostly eliminate disparities in
    outcomes including fighting at school, driving drunk, and using
    cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy. Methodologically, we find that some
    methods are better than others at addressing the issue of data
    integrity, with boosted regressions coupled with data removal
    leading to potentially very large decreases in the estimates of
    LGBQ-heterosexual disparities, but regression adjustment having
    almost no effect. While the empirical focus of this article is on
    LGBQ youth, the issues discussed are relevant to research on other
    minority groups and youth generally, and speak to survey
    development, methodology, and the robustness and transparency of
    research.

- abstract: The number of studies on lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)
    students has grown over the past years. Nevertheless, a small amount
    of research exists examining the lives of our trans\* collegians.
    This article adds to this scholarship by exploring the nature of
    trans\* students' relationships within collegiate environments.
    Specifically, this study elucidates the different discourses on
    gender identity that influence students forming academic, romantic,
    and social partnerships on campuses. Findings reveal how
    participants resist societal expectations of educating others on
    their gender identity. Implications of this research illuminate how
    student affairs professionals assist trans\* students in creating
    relationships, as well as highlighting the responsibility of
    staff/faculty in higher education.

- abstract: Using Add Health data, the authors provide evidence that
    some adolescents gave inaccurate and/or invalid responses on a
    self-administered questionnaire. Further analyses show that these
    adolescents were much more likely to report extreme levels on
    psychosocial and behavioral outcome variables. A distinction was
    made between inaccurate responders (e.g., inaccurate/false responses
    due to carelessness or confusion) and jokesters (e.g., intentional
    false responses). The findings show that the jokesters showed
    considerably more pronounced distorting effects on some psychosocial
    and behavioral outcome variables than the inaccurate responders did.
    The authors suggest that although this jokester effect may not
    seriously bias the results in studies that focus on large groups,
    for research focusing on some special subgroups (e.g., adoption
    groups, immigrant groups, disability groups), this effect could pose
    a serious challenge for the validity of research findings.

- abstract: "Among the different Science, Technology, Engineering, and
    Math fields, engineering continues to have one of the highest rates
    of attrition (Hewlett et al., 2008). The turnover rate for women
    engineers from engineering fields is even higher than for men
    (Frehill, 2010). Despite increased efforts from researchers, there
    are still large gaps in our understanding of the reasons that women
    leave engineering. This study aims to address this gap by examining
    the reasons why women leave engineering. Specifically, we analyze
    the reasons for departure given by national sample of 1,464 women
    engineers who left the profession after having worked in the
    engineering field. We applied a person-environment fit theoretical
    lens, in particular, the Theory of Work Adjustment (TWA) (Dawis and
    Lofquist, 1984) to understand and categorize the reasons for leaving
    the engineering field. According to the TWA, occupations have
    different \"reinforcer patterns,\" reflected in six occupational
    values, and a mismatch between the reinforcers provided by the work
    environment and individuals' needs may trigger departure from the
    environment. Given the paucity of literature in this area, we posed
    research questions to explore the reinforcer pattern of values
    implicated in women's decisions to leave the engineering field. We
    used qualitative analyses to understand, categorize, and code the
    1,863 statements that offered a glimpse into the myriad reasons that
    women offered in describing their decisions to leave the engineering
    profession. Our results revealed the top three sets of reasons
    underlying women's decision to leave the jobs and engineering field
    were related to: first, poor and/or inequitable compensation, poor
    working conditions, inflexible and demanding work environment that
    made work-family balance difficult; second, unmet achievement needs
    that reflected a dissatisfaction with effective utilization of their
    math and science skills, and third, unmet needs with regard to lack
    of recognition at work and adequate opportunities for advancement.
    Implications of these results for future research as well as the
    design of effective intervention programs aimed at women engineers'
    retention and engagement in engineering are discussed."

- abstract: Little research has explored the experiences of transgender
    or gender-nonconforming (TGNC) students in higher education.
    Further, only 1 study has included the perspectives of TGNC graduate
    students (McKinney, 2005), and the experiences of students who
    identify with nonbinary gender identities (e.g., genderqueer,
    agender) are scarce in the literature (Nicolazzo, 2016a, 2016b).
    This study aims to address these gaps. Ninety-one graduate students
    completed an online survey aimed at understanding the perspectives
    of TGNC students in higher education. Of these 91 students, 27 (30%)
    identified as binary trans (e.g., trans man, trans woman) and 64
    (70%) identified as nonbinary trans (e.g., genderqueer). Most
    respondents had concerns about their physical or emotional safety
    that impacted their gender presentation on campus (e.g., students
    presented as more masculine or feminine than they would prefer, to
    avoid negative treatment). Misgendering by peers, faculty, and
    advisors was a common stressor, the nature and meaning of which
    differed somewhat for nonbinary and binary identified students.
    Interactions with faculty advisors were identified as salient
    contexts for experiencing affirmation versus invalidation of one's
    gender identity. Findings highlight the need for institutions of
    higher education to better anticipate, support, and meet the needs
    of TGNC graduate students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA,

- abstract: "This article considers how women in a gendered profession,
    engineering, construct their professional identity in response to
    workplace interpersonal interactions that marginalize it. Using data
    from interviews with women engineers, it also explores how these
    interactions influence the engineers' sense of self and belonging in
    engineering. The interpersonal interactions place professional
    identity on the periphery and can overly validate gender identity. I
    discuss two types of identity construction strategies employed by
    the participants in response to these marginalizing interactions:
    impression management tactics and coping strategies. Although the
    data demonstrate that participants may be left feeling devalued or
    ambivalent towards their identity or fit in engineering, some
    interactions are more validating and offer a sense of belonging.
    This article also reflects on how the engineers' actions may, in
    fact, represent forces for change in the gendered culture of
    engineering."

- abstract: "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the
    extent to which transgender people have observed negative
    transgender-related messages in the media and the relationship
    between negative media message exposure and the mental health of
    transgender people.Methods: In 2019, 545 transgender adults
    completed an online survey assessing demographics, negative
    transgender-related media messages, violence, and mental health.
    Separate multivariable logistic regression models examined the
    association of frequency of negative media exposure and clinically
    significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress
    disorder (PTSD), and global psychological distress.Results: Mean age
    of the sample was 31.2 years (standard deviation \\[SD\\] = 11.2).
    Nearly half identified as nonbinary (42.2%), 82.0% were White,
    non-Hispanic, 56.9% had a college degree, and 67.0% were financially
    insecure. The majority reported experiencing childhood abuse (60.6%)
    and abuse in adulthood (58.0%). The mean frequency of exposure to
    negative transgender-related media was 6.41 (SD = 2.9) with 97.6% of
    the sample reporting exposure to negative media depictions of
    transgender people across a range of mediums. In separate
    multivariable models adjusted for age, gender identity, race,
    education, income, and childhood/adult abuse, more frequent exposure
    to negative depictions of transgender people in the media was
    significantly associated with clinically significant symptoms of
    depression (adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\] = 1.18; 95% confidence
    interval \\[CI\\] = 1.08--1.29; p = 0.0003); anxiety (aOR = 1.26; 95%
    CI = 1.14--1.40; p \\<\\< 0.0001); PTSD (aOR = 1.25; 95%
    CI = 1.16--1.34; p \\<\\< 0.0001); and global psychological distress
    (aOR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.15--1.42; p \\<\\< 0.0001).Conclusion:
    Exposure to negative media messages from multiple sources
    necessitates multilevel interventions to improve the mental health
    of transgender people and curb stigma at its source."

- abstract: The authors investigate sex differences in mean scores and
    variance, in general and specific intelligence, based on raw data
    from the standardization samples of six cognitive ability measures
    adapted and normed in Romania. The results show that fewer than 10%
    of the possible comparisons exhibit sex differences; these
    differences have a random pattern and are not replicated across
    measures. The authors conclude that these Romanian data show no
    support for the sex differences in either mean values or variance of
    scores which were reported by other studies.

- abstract: "The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) is the largest
    survey examining the experiences of transgender people in the United
    States, with 27,715 respondents from all fifty states, the District
    of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. military
    bases overseas. Conducted in the summer of 2015 by the National
    Center for Transgender Equality, the USTS was an anonymous, online
    survey for transgender adults (18 and older) in the United States,
    available in English and Spanish. The USTS serves as a follow-up to
    the groundbreaking 2008--09 National Transgender Discrimination
    Survey (NTDS), which helped to shift how the public and policymakers
    view the lives of transgender people and the challenges they face.
    The report of the 2015 USTS provides a detailed look at the
    experiences of transgender people across a wide range of categories,
    such as education, employment, family life, health, housing, and
    interactions with the criminal justice system. The findings reveal
    disturbing patterns of mistreatment and discrimination and startling
    disparities between transgender people in the survey and the U.S.
    population when it comes to the most basic elements of life, such as
    finding a job, having a place to live, accessing medical care, and
    enjoying the support of family and community. Survey respondents
    also experienced harassment and violence at alarmingly high rates.
    Several themes emerge from the thousands of data points presented in
    the full survey report. \\[CVRL Note: see also the report in Spanish,
    breakout reports, and state reports on transequality.org; appendices

- abstract: A Media Matters study of interactions (reactions, comments,
    shares) on published online content about trans topics shared on
    Facebook found that right-leaning sources earned considerably higher
    engagement than all other sources combined.This study comes after
    Media Matters has extensively and repeatedly debunked allegations of
    a bias against right-wing content on Facebook. Despite this,
    Facebook has consistently caved to conservative demands. It has
    granted conservatives top positions at the company, included
    right-wing Breitbart News in a list of trusted news sources,
    met with right-wing media personalities like Tucker Carlson, and
    allowed the "trending"trending function to be taken over by an
    algorithm that often promotes false, partisan right-wing news.We
    looked at 225 pieces of high-performing content on trans topics --
    articles, blog posts, videos -- which earned a combined total of
    nearly 66 million interactions on Facebook. Content about trans
    people and related topics from right-leaning sources constituted
    65.7% of those interactions. Comparatively, 15.4% of all
    interactions were earned by content from queer sources, 3.9% from
    left-leaning sources, 10.4% from nonaligned sources, and 4.6% from
    \"other\" sources.In particular, content from right-leaning sources
    about trans athletes and about medical care for trans folks,
    specifically trans youth, earned high engagement, and right-wing
    outlets The Daily Wire and LifeSiteNews published more
    high-performing Facebook content about trans issues than any other
    outlets. This has consequences. Millions of Americans get their news
    from Facebook and other social media platforms; Pew Research Center
    found that 52% of Americans get news on Facebook. Media Matters'
    analysis of trans-related content shared on Facebook shows that
    those Americans are often getting biased, bigoted, and
    misinformative news. This content directly harms public discourse
    and policy surrounding trans folks. Furthermore, this discourse has
    undoubtedly led to the online harassment and abuse of trans people,
    who have been victims of doxxing -- the act of publishing a person's
    private or personal information, including address or location. In
    fact, according to a 2019 Forbes report, "12% of all conversations
    about being trans contain abuse."12% of all conversations about
    being trans contain abuse. In response to such abuse, the United
    Kingdom has used "malicious communication"malicious communication
    policies that address the targeting and harassment of trans people
    online, among other issues.

- abstract: The underlying assumption in popular and scientific
    publications on sex differences in the brain is that human brains
    can take one of two forms "male" or "female," and that the
    differences between these two forms underlie differences between men
    and women in personality, cognition, emotion, and behavior.
    Documented sex differences in brain structure are typically taken to
    support this dimorphic view of the brain. However, neuroanatomical
    data reveal that sex interacts with other factors in utero and
    throughout life to determine the structure of the brain, and that
    because these interactions are complex, the result is a
    multi-morphic, rather than a dimorphic, brain. More specifically,
    here I argue that human brains are composed of an ever-changing
    heterogeneous mosaic of "male" and "female" brain characteristics
    (rather than being all "male" or all "female") that cannot be
    aligned on a continuum between a "male brain" and a "female brain."
    I further suggest that sex differences in the direction of change in
    the brain mosaic following specific environmental events lead to sex
    differences in neuropsychiatric disorders.

- abstract: In contemporary psychology, normal development is contingent
    on the establishment of a coherent, universal, stable and unitary
    'core gender identity'. The present study assessed the perception of
    gender identity in 'normative' individuals in Israel using the newly
    constructed Multi-Gender Identity Questionnaire (Multi-GIQ). The
    Multi-GIQ includes 32 items assessing gender identity (Feeling like
    a woman, Feeling like a man, Feeling like both a man and a woman,
    Feeling like neither), gender dysphoria (Contentment with affirmed
    gender and the wish to be the 'other' gender, Contentment with one's
    sexed body) and gender performance (Compliance with gender norms in
    clothing and language). Of the Men (n = 570) and Women (n = 1585)
    that participated in the study, over 35% felt to some extent as the
    'other' gender, as both men and women and/or as neither. Although
    such feelings were more prevalent and on average stronger in Queers
    (n = 70), the range of scores for all measures of gender identity
    was highly similar in Queers and non-Queers. A similar pattern was
    obtained for measures of gender dysphoria and gender performance.
    Sexual orientation was not a major contributor to the perception of
    gender identity in both Men and Women. We discuss our results in
    view of the current debate around the terminology and diagnostic
    criteria of gender dysphoria (a substitutive category for Gender
    Identity Disorder) in DSM-V. We conclude that the current view of
    gender identity as binary and unitary does not reflect the
    experience of many individuals, and call for a new conceptualisation
    of gender, which relates to multiplicity and fluidity in the
    experience of gender.

- abstract: Following eleven years' work, in 1998 a high-level Vatican
    commission instituted by Pope John Paul II offered what has become
    the official position of the Roman Catholic Church denying any
    responsibility for fomenting the kind of demonization of the Jews
    that made the Holocaust possible. In a 2001 book, The popes against
    the Jews, I demonstrated that in fact the church played a major role
    in leading Catholics throughout Europe to view Jews as an
    existential threat. Yet defenders of the church position continue to
    deny the historical evidence and to launch ferocious ad hominem
    attacks against scholars who have researched the subject. The
    anti-Semitism promulgated by the church can be seen as part of the
    long battle it waged against modernity, with which the Jews were
    identified.

    reported in Vol 97(4) of Journal of Personality and Social
    Psychology (see record 2009-16971-002). The affiliation for William
    von Hippel is incorrect. The affiliation should have been University
    of Queensland.\\] Social identity threat is the notion that one of a
    person's many social identities may be at risk of being devalued in
    a particular context (C. M. Steele, S. J. Spencer, & J. Aronson,
    2002). The authors suggest that in domains in which women are
    already negatively stereotyped, interacting with a sexist man can
    trigger social identity threat, undermining women's performance. In
    Study 1, male engineering students who scored highly on a subtle
    measure of sexism behaved in a dominant and sexually interested way
    toward an ostensible female classmate. In Studies 2 and 3, female
    engineering students who interacted with such sexist men, or with
    confederates trained to behave in the same way, performed worse on
    an engineering test than did women who interacted with nonsexist
    men. Study 4 replicated this finding and showed that women's
    underperformance did not extend to an English test, an area in which
    women are not negatively stereotyped. Study 5 showed that
    interacting with sexist men leads women to suppress concerns about
    gender stereotypes, an established mechanism of stereotype threat.
    Discussion addresses implications for social identity threat and for
    women's performance in school and at work. (PsycINFO Database Record

- abstract: Female gaming is a relatively under-researched area, and
    female gamers often report experiencing harassment whilst playing
    online. The present study explored female experiences of social
    support while playing online video games, because of the previous
    research suggesting that females often experience harassment and
    negative interactions during game play. Data were collected from an
    online discussion forum, and comprised posts drawn from 271 female
    gamers. Thematic analysis of the discussions suggested that a lack
    of social support and harassment frequently led to female gamers
    playing alone, playing anonymously, and moving groups regularly. The
    female gamers reported experiencing anxiety and loneliness due to
    this lack of social support, and for many, this was mirrored in
    their experiences of social support outside of gaming. The female
    gamers frequently accepted the incorporation into their gaming of
    specific coping strategies to mitigate online harassment, including
    actively hiding their identity and avoiding all forms of verbal
    communication with other players. These themes are discussed in
    relation to relevant research in the area, along with
    recommendations for future research and consideration of possible
    explanations for the themes observed.

  type: article-journal
  url: "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288820"
  volume: 39
- abstract: "Background Engineering can play a significant role in the
    public good. Changing political dynamics and a surge in activism
    among the broader science community have only heightened this
    reality. Yet little published research exists about how engineering
    students develop both their technical and political identities to
    affect the broader society. Purpose This study sought to extend and
    complicate notions of engineering education that grapple with the
    political preparation of undergraduate students. The research
    question was the following: In what ways do students majoring in
    engineering navigate the process of acquiring an attitude of
    political fluency? Design Case study methodology informed the
    research design with undergraduate engineering majors serving as the
    primary unit of analysis. Focus groups involving a total of 20
    students and a review of electronic documents were conducted across
    three institutions in the Northeastern U.S. to produce data for this
    qualitative study. Results Engineering students described
    experiencing the following tensions that shaped their political
    involvement: (a) limited exposure to politically motivating events,
    (b) privileging private gains while noting aspirational
    contributions to the public good, and (c) politics positioned at the
    periphery of engineering. Conclusions Consistent with increased
    attention to social justice and civic engagement outcomes, political
    engagement is a critical educational outcome for engineering
    educators to cultivate. However, if engineering programs are to
    contribute to the political identity formation of their students,
    structural changes in the preparation of engineering students will
    be necessary."

- abstract: "The event known as #GamerGate (GG) emphasized the need to
    take the study of game culture seriously and pursue it across
    several platforms. It demonstrated how seemingly ephemeral media
    created echo chambers of anger, and how the outbursts of
    hypermasculine aggression exemplified by hooligans also can connect
    to games and play. Starting from how GG gained popular attention,
    this article outlines and discusses the nature of GG, the relation
    to the victims, the sense of victimization among the participants,
    and how it may have been provoked by the long-standing, general
    disregard of games as a culture and a cultural artifact of value. It
    discusses GG as a swarm using this metaphor to describe its
    self-organizing nature. Further comparing GG to hooligans, this
    article also introduces a class and marginalization aspect to
    understanding the event, opening up for discourses that complicates
    the image of game culture as mainly a culture of isolated
    consumption."

    explicitly femi-nist work in engineering and engineering education.
    What does it mean in engineering contexts to take a feminist
    perspective, and how might this influence the profession and
    society? We seek to establish an under-standing of feminist
    perspectives in the engineering community broadly to recognize the
    connectedness of all forms of social injustice. Thus feminist
    visions of engineering might address a broad set of concerns such as
    militarism, racism, and global economic inequality as well as sexism
    and heterosexism. Our exploration of three feminist frameworks
    within engineering generates a set of questions for future research
    and institutional transformation. Keywords: liberative pedagogies /
    social justice / ethic of care / engineering / feminist technology
    studies."

- abstract: This study focuses on women's position in engineering. A
    conflict model that emphasizes the interplay of structural and
    interactional resources is developed to explain the occupational
    positions of women engineers. A central feature of this model is the
    "culture of engineering"---the socially defined standard of behavior
    and interaction among engineers. This model is used to explain the
    occupational experiences of a cohort of male and female engineers.
    Males and females with virtually identical qualifications and
    occupational attitudes show dissimilar current job status. It is
    argued that the culture of engineering, strongly identified with the
    male gender role, works against women. Where that culture is
    strongest, women do most poorly in occupational status and mobility.

- abstract: This article introduces novel sensitivity-analysis
    procedures for investigating and reducing the bias that mischievous
    responders (i.e., youths who provide extreme, and potentially
    untruthful, responses to multiple questions) often introduce in
    adolescent disparity estimates based on data from self-administered
    questionnaires (SAQs). Mischievous responders affect a wide range of
    disparity estimates, including those between adoptees and
    nonadoptees, sexual minorities and nonminorities, and individuals
    with and without disabilities. Thus, the procedures introduced here
    have broad relevance to research and can be widely, and easily,
    implemented. The sensitivity-analysis procedures are illustrated
    with SAQ data from youths in Grades 9--12 (N = 11,829) to examine
    between-group disparities based on sexual identity, gender identity,
    and physical disability. Sensitivity analyses revealed that each
    disparity estimated with these data was extremely sensitive to the
    presence of potentially mischievous responders. Patterns were
    similar across multiple approaches to dealing with mischievous
    responders, across various outcomes, and across different
    between-group comparisons. Mischievous responders are ubiquitous in
    adolescent research using SAQs and can, even in small numbers, lead
    to inaccurate conclusions that substantively affect research,
    policy, and public discourse regarding a variety of disparities.
    This article calls attention to this widespread problem and provides
    practical suggestions for assessing it, even when data are already
    collected.

- abstract: Ever since Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the US
    presidency in June 2015, journalists, scholars, and other
    commentators in the United States have attempted to explain his
    political success with the aid of historical analogies. In so doing,
    they have sparked a wider debate about whether the Nazi past helps
    to make sense of the US present. One group in the debate has
    contended that Trump's ascent bears a worrisome resemblance to
    interwar European fascism, especially the National Socialist
    movement of Adolf Hitler. By contrast, a second group has rejected
    this comparison and sought analogies for Trump in other historical
    figures from European and US history. This article surveys the
    course, and assesses the results, of the debate from its origins up
    to the present day. It shows that historians of Germany have played
    a prominent role in helping to make sense of Trump, but notes that
    their use of Nazi analogies may be distorting, rather than
    deepening, our understanding of contemporary political trends. By
    examining the merits and drawbacks of Nazi analogies in present-day
    popular discourse, the article recommends that scholars draw on both
    the German and American historical experience in order to best
    assess the United States's present political movement., Seitdem
    Donald Trump im Juni 2015 seine Bewerbung um das US-Präsidentenamt
    bekanntgab, haben Journalist\*innen, Wissenschaftler\*innen und
    andere Kommentator\*innen in den Vereinigten Staaten versucht,
    seinen politischen Erfolg mit Hilfe historischer Analogien zu
    erklären. Damit haben sie eine breitere Debatte darüber angestoßen,
    ob die nationalsozialistische Vergangenheit helfen kann, die
    US-amerikanische Gegenwart zu deuten. Eine Gruppe hat in dieser
    Debatte verfochten, dass der Aufstieg Trumps besorgniserregende
    Ähnlichkeit mit dem europäischen Faschismus der Zwischenkriegszeit
    aufweise, insbesondere mit der nationalsozialistischen Bewegung
    Adolf Hitlers. Im Gegensatz dazu hat eine zweite Gruppe diesen
    Vergleich zurückgewiesen und Analogien zu Trump bei anderen
    historischen Gestalten aus der Geschichte Europas und der
    Vereinigten Staaten gesucht. Dieser Beitrag verfolgt den Verlauf
    dieser Debatte und bewertet ihre Ergebnisse von ihren Anfängen bis
    heute. Er zeigt, dass zu Deutschland arbeitende Historiker\*innen
    bei der Einschätzung Trumps eine prominente Rolle gespielt haben,
    weist aber darauf hin, dass deren Gebrauch von Analogien mit dem
    Nationalsozialismus unser Verständnis gegenwärtiger politischer
    Trends möglicherweise eher verzerrt als vertieft. Indem er die
    Vorzüge und die Nachteile des Nazi-Vergleichs im heutigen populären
    Diskurs untersucht, empfiehlt er, dass Wissenschaftler\*innen sowohl
    deutsche als auch amerikanische historische Erfahrungen heranziehen
    sollten, um den gegenwärtigen politischen Moment der USA möglichst
    gut einschätzen zu können.

- abstract: "Engineering is often described as an enduring bastion of
    masculine culture where women experience marginality. Using diaries
    from undergraduate engineering students at four universities, the
    authors explore women's interpretations of their status within the
    profession. The authors' findings show that women recognize their
    marginality, providing clear and strong criticisms of their
    experiences. But these criticisms remain isolated and muted; they
    coalesce neither into broader organizational or institutional
    criticisms of engineering, nor into calls for change. Instead, their
    criticisms are interpreted through two values central to engineering
    culture: meritocracy and individualism. Despite their direct
    experiences with sexism, respondents typically embrace these values
    as ideological justifications of the existing distributions of
    status and reward in engineering and come to view engineering's
    nonmeritocratic system as meritocratic. The unquestioned presumption
    of meritocracy and the invisibility of its muting effects on
    critiques resembles not hegemonic masculinity---for these women
    proudly celebrate their femininity---but a hegemony of meritocratic
    ideology. The authors conclude that engineering education
    successfully turns potential critics into agents of cultural
    reproduction. This article contributes to ongoing debates concerning
    diversity in STEM professions by showing how professional culture
    can contribute to more general patterns of token behavior---thus
    identifying mechanisms of cultural reproduction that thwart
    institutional change."

- abstract: "Stereotypes reduce women's identification with science,
    technology, engineering, and math (STEM), which can decrease their
    motivation to enter STEM domains. Stereotypes may be gender-based
    (e.g., STEM is for men) or trait-based (e.g., STEM is for geniuses).
    In this study, I explored two primary research questions: First,
    would stereotyping STEM as a domain for nerdy geniuses negatively
    relate to women's STEM identity? Second, would STEM identity mediate
    the relation between stereotypes and STEM motivation? Nerd-genius
    stereotypes and gender stereotypes negatively contributed to women's
    STEM identity. STEM identity positively contributed to women's STEM
    motivation (including expectancy-value beliefs). Participants were a
    diverse sample of undergraduate women (N = 195, mean age was 19.8;
    30% of participants were Latina, 30% European, 24% Asian).
    Stereotype measures were (1) implicit gender-STEM associations, (2)
    explicit gender associations about STEM, and (3) a new scale that
    measured nerd-genius stereotypes. The results highlight the unique
    contribution different stereotypes make toward women's
    identification with STEM and, in turn, their motivation to pursue
    STEM pathways. Practice implications include addressing nerd-genius
    stereotypes in STEM interventions and reducing classroom artifacts
    that might be reminiscent of these stereotypes."

- abstract: Professionals in science, technology, engineering, and math
    (STEM) are often stereotyped as geniuses and nerds (e.g., socially
    awkward). These stereotypes may demotivate some individuals from
    pursuing or remaining in STEM. However, these beliefs may enhance
    motivation among individuals who feel that they fit in with the
    stereotype. Guided by balanced identity theory and expectancy-value
    theory, our study investigated the effect of trait-based stereotypes
    about people in STEM among a sample of 256 U.S. high school students
    (Mage = 16, 59% girls, 65% Asian, 15% Latinx, 10% White). We
    assessed students' trait-based nerd and genius stereotypes about
    STEM and related self-concepts as well as their STEM motivation
    (competence and value beliefs). Consistent with balanced identity
    theory, the effect and direction of endorsing nerd-genius
    stereotypes was moderated by a student's own self-concepts.
    Endorsing stereotypes was negatively related to motivation---but
    only among those low in the related self-concept. Among those high
    in related self-concepts (e.g., high in nerd-genius self-concept),
    endorsing STEM stereotypes (e.g., STEM is for geniuses) was
    unrelated to STEM motivation. Girls, underrepresented students of
    color, and potential first-generation college students may
    especially be negatively affected by the stereotypes due to a
    greater likelihood that these stereotypes will be incongruent with
    their self-concepts. Thus, trait-based stereotypes about people in
    STEM may perpetuate current gaps in STEM.

- abstract: According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey,
    transgender students in K-12 settings experience high rates of
    harassment (78 percent), physical assault (35 percent), and even
    sexual violence (12 percent). In response to the mounting evidence
    of discrimination, the Obama administration in May 2016 issued a
    \"Dear Colleague\" letter, authored jointly by the Departments of
    Justice and Education, extending sex discrimination protections to
    transgender students--an interpretation of Title IX that was
    reversed by the Trump administration in February 2017. Many of these
    transgender students matriculate at colleges and universities across
    the country. What do we know about their background, experiences,
    and expectations? To explore this question, the authors conducted an
    analysis of data from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program
    (CIRP) Freshman Survey, which was modified in 2015 to allow students
    to indicate whether they identify as transgender. That change
    enabled them to disaggregate data for a sample of incoming
    first-year students consisting of 678 transgender students from 209
    colleges and universities. They compared these data to the national
    norms for all incoming first-time, full-time college
    students--including the transgender students, who comprise less than
    one half of one percent of the total. To develop a holistic picture
    and to avoid a deficit framing, the authors took care in their
    analysis to present examples of experiences that demonstrate how
    transgender students exercise agency over their needs and their
    lives, in addition to examples of areas where these students fare
    worse than incoming students overall.

- abstract: Identity is a concept that figuratively combines the
    intimate or personal world with the collective space of cultural
    forms and social relations.(Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, &amp;
    Cain, 1998, p. 4)In everyday speech referring to someone as an
    engineer signals their having an engineering identity -- marking
    that person as belonging to a group of people who practice
    engineering. In the popular imagination, engineers mistakenly tend
    to be considered (at least in the United States) as socially inept
    sorts who are fascinated with gadgets and fixing things, more
    practical than scientists, and somehow brainier than technicians. As
    such, though "engineer" provides vernacular shorthand for everyday
    conversation, research on engineering identity unpacks nuanced ways
    of being engineers, as well as delineates how being an engineer
    relates to doing engineering. Engineers' identification with their
    profession can be critical for persistence, both as a student and
    then as a professional (see Chapter 16 by Lichtenstein, Chen, Smith,
    &amp; Maldonado, this volume). Studies show that a lack of
    identification with, and by, engineering often motivates students to
    migrate out of engineering into other majors and can be a barrier
    for students in other majors to move into engineering (Seymour &amp;
    Hewitt, 1997; Tonso, 2006a; see also Chapter 15 by Sheppard,
    Gilmartin, Brunhaver, &amp; Antonio, this volume). In fact, identity
    and learning prove interconnected, as delineated by several scholars
    in the situated learning tradition from cultural anthropology
    (Greeno, 2006; Johri &amp; Olds, 2011; Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991;
    Tonso, 1997; Wenger, 1998). Within this tradition, learning is
    itself conceptualized as a change in identity that comes with
    participation. As learners move from novices to mature
    practitioners, they likewise shift from peripheral participation to
    fuller participation; they undergo identity transformations and
    their identifying with a community of practice becomes a central
    part of the learning that takes place. According to this
    perspective, students learn as they engage in meaningful activities,
    involved not only in the learning of content, but also in learning
    how to put content learning into perspective, gain conceptual
    understanding, and become part of a community. But, though
    self-identification grounds an emerging engineering identity, as
    Tonso (1999, 2006a) demonstrated, being identified by the community
    as belonging also proves crucial, and lack of identification can
    interfere with belonging for some with well-regarded competencies.

- abstract: "Antisemitism forms the theoretical core of White
    nationalism. First, it allows us to identify the fuel that White
    nationalist ideology uses to power its anti-Black racism, its
    contempt for other people of color, and its xenophobia---as well as
    the misogyny and other forms of hatred it holds dear. White
    supremacism---inscribed de jure by the Jim Crow regime and upheld de
    facto outside the South---had been the law of the land, and a
    Black-led social movement had toppled the political regime that
    supported it. How could a race of inferiors have unseated this power
    structure through organizing alone? Some secret cabal, some
    mythological power, must be manipulating the social order behind
    the scenes. And the second reason that White nationalist
    antisemitism must not be dismissed: at the bedrock of the movement
    is an explicit claim that Jews are a race of their own, and that
    their ostensible position as White folks in the U.S. represents the
    greatest trick the devil ever played."

- abstract: Increasing levels of far-right extremist violence have
    generated public concern about the spread of radicalization in the
    United States. Previous research suggests that radicalized
    individuals are destabilized by various environmental (or endemic)
    factors, exposed to extremist ideology, and subsequently reinforced
    by members of their community. As such, the spread of radicalization
    may proceed through a social contagion process, in which extremist
    ideologies behave like complex contagions that require multiple
    exposures for adoption. In this study, I applied an epidemiological
    method called two-component spatio-temporal intensity modeling to
    data from 416 far-right extremists exposed in the United States
    between 2005 and 2017. The results indicate that patterns of
    far-right radicalization in the United States are consistent with a
    complex contagion process, in which reinforcement is required for
    transmission. Both social media usage and group membership enhance
    the spread of extremist ideology, suggesting that online and
    physical organizing remain primary recruitment tools of the
    far-right movement. In addition, I identified several endemic
    factors, such as poverty, that increase the probability of
    radicalization in particular regions. Future research should
    investigate how specific interventions, such as online
    counter-narratives to battle propaganda, may be effectively
    implemented to mitigate the spread of far-right extremism in the
    United States.

- abstract: While research focusing on friendships of sexual minority
    individuals has increased over the last two decades, studies of
    transgender persons' friendships have been largely absent. Yet,
    within mainstream literature it has been demonstrated that
    friendships are central both to identity formation and as support in
    terms of psychological need and distress. Given that trans people
    face important identity challenges and may well be disenfranchised
    within society, the role of friendships warrants study. Research
    which has occurred has largely focussed on trans women, yet trans
    men face particular issues in terms of their relationships with
    lesbian women and being positioned as joining patriarchy. This study
    explored this gap in the literature and used Foucauldian discourse
    analysis to explore friendship and gender identity. Dominant
    discourses identified included 'friends as family', 'romance' and
    discursive practices of 'disowning male privilege', 'effeminate
    heterosexual male' and 'gender fluidity' which counter hegemonic
    (trans) male re-positioning within friendships. The results indicate
    that trans men elevate the status of friends to those of other
    culturally dominant relationships (e.g. family or sexual partner).
    Furthermore, their friendships, in particular friendships with
    lesbian women, can become complex platforms from which to contest
    privilege and power associated with their (trans) masculinities.
    Conceptual and research implications are discussed.

- abstract: "This article compares how COVID-19 affected state--society
    relations differently in two relatively similar countries: Brazil
    and Argentina. Bringing together social movement theories and
    ideational institutionalism, we argue that variation in responses to
    the COVID-19 pandemic is explained by the different roles played by
    social movements inside and outside government and by contrasting
    ideational disputes. The extreme uncertainty introduced by the
    pandemic generated intense contestation about the meaning of the
    crisis and how to resolve it. In Brazil, progressive social
    movements not only were excluded from the government coalition, but
    also had to combat a powerful discourse that denied the existence of
    a crisis altogether. Such denialism did not flourish in the same way
    in Argentina, where progressive social movements were part of
    national government processes. The result was that in Argentina,
    movement--government dynamics revolved around constructing long-term
    policy proposals, whereas in Brazil movements focused on short-term
    emergency responses."

- abstract: We are amidst what can be termed an ongoing authoritarian
    turn in global politics. While Trump, one of its important examples,
    is no longer in office in the United States, there remain many
    countries under the sway of authoritarian leaders, such as Turkey,
    Egypt, Brazil, Hungary and the Philippines. The policies of Trump,
    Sisi, Bolsonaro, Orban and Duterte can be characterized as
    authoritarian developmentalism. Although they have come to power
    through democratic elections, these leaders are undermining some of
    the key tenets of democratic societies. While their policies are
    couched in nationalist terms and call for the strengthening of the
    state, they can also be seen as a continuation of the prevailing
    neoliberal global order. This introduction to a special issue ends
    by reflecting on the conditions necessary launch effective
    resistance movements against authoritarian developmentalism and the
    broader challenge of building vibrant political democracies in
    post-neoliberal times.

- abstract: The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, while addressing
    the United Nations General Assembly on 26 September 2020, stated
    that India had introduced legal reforms to accord rights to
    transgender citizens. Even though there is not much material basis
    to these rights, transgender communities have been protesting
    against the state and at times negotiating with it to get laws that
    are more in alignment with their rights. In the wake of serialised
    deaths and precarity intensified by the Covid-19 pandemic,
    transgender communities also stage other negotiations in the
    everyday with activists, transnationally funded NGOs and academics
    researching their communities, encounters that are not as
    spectacular as the protests against the state, but that which
    ensures their daily sustenance. This paper investigates how they
    inhabit these systemically violent institutions. Deploying
    ethnographic field notes from eastern India, this paper argues that
    they inhabit them subjunctively, which is not about refusing
    engagement with what is oppressive but about the ceaseless conjuring
    of improvisatory and contingent gestures that are marked by hope as
    well as uncertainty. The simultaneity of protests, rage,
    hopelessness, hope, negotiations, supplications and scepticism allow
    them to not only endure the violence of institutions but also to
    rupture them and imagine them otherwise.

    between the two hegemonic projects of neoliberalism and Hindutva and
    the reinforcement/reconstruction of patriarchal gender relations in

    specific legal interventions show the fusion of the two in the
    construction of the family/nation/gender related to population
    regulation, governance of populations, the forging of a paternal
    contract, the move from welfare to financialization and the
    undermining of labour rights through regulatory and disciplinary
    labour codes. The convergence of neoliberalism and Hindutva results
    in a shift from rights-based entitlements to further commodification
    and digital financialization and the creation of a hindutvatised
    neoliberal subjectivity. Keywords: Neoliberal authoritarianism,

- abstract: This article examines the contradictory relationship between
    neoliberalism and the politics of the far-right. It seeks to
    identify and explain the divergence of the 'economic' and the
    social/cultural spheres under neoliberalism (notably in
    articulations of race and class and the 'politics of whiteness') and
    how such developments play out in the politics of the contemporary
    far-right. We also seek to examine the degree to which the politics
    of the far-right pose problems for the consolidation and long-term
    stabilization of neoliberalism, through acting as a populist source
    of pressure on the conservative-right and tapping into sources of
    alienation amongst déclassé social layers. Finally, we locate the
    politics of the far-right within the broader atrophying of political
    representation and accountability of the neoliberal era with respect
    to the institutional and legal organization of neoliberalism at the
    international level, as most obviously highlighted in the ongoing
    crisis of the EU and Eurozone.

  url: "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/transgenders-from-tamil-nadu-wb-sought-most-aid-during-lockdown/articleshow/80611704.cms"
- abstract: The article analyzes how conjunctures between Indian
    activism for gender/sexual rights, the governmental state and
    transnational developmental agencies create bounded and exclusionary
    rubrics of gender and sexual identification. I argue that such
    institutional linkages serve to consolidate rubrics of legible
    identification that legitimize certain forms of gender/sexual
    difference for inclusion within developmental programs and
    citizenship, while other forms of subjecthood and community
    formation are rendered unintelligible or illegitimate. Drawing from
    ethnographic research conducted in eastern India between 2007 and
    2012, the article focuses on male-assigned gender variant same-sex
    desiring subjects and their interpellation within identitarian
    categories like transgender and MSM (men who have sex with men).
    While the globalization of transgender as a form of political
    identity has promised greater rights and governmental inclusion for
    gender variant persons, it entails a broader MSM-transgender schema
    of identification based on a standardized divide between cisgendered
    homosexuals and male-to-female transgender persons. Various
    expressions of lower class/caste gender/sexual variance are rendered
    illegible in this rubric, delegitimizing associated subjects who are
    left without access to constitutional rights and protections and/or
    treated as exploitable populations within the development and
    HIV-AIDS industries.

- abstract: This essay is a set of reflections arising out of prolonged
    conversations in which we compared notes on our respective
    experiences as activist (Raina) and ethnographer (Aniruddha) working
    among, and to different extents belonging to, gender/sexually
    marginalized communities in eastern India. As we shall argue, the
    attempted universalization of transgender as a transnational
    "umbrella term" by the development (nongovernmental) sector, the
    state, and their funders tends to subsume South Asian discourses and
    practices of gender/sexual variance as merely "local" expressions of
    transgender identity, without interrogating the conceptual baggage
    (such as homo-trans and cis-trans binaries) associated with the
    transgender category. In the Indian context, this process bolsters
    the long-standing and continuing (post)colonial construction of
    hierarchies of scale between transnational, regional, and local
    levels of discourse and praxis, as evidenced in the relation between
    the hegemonic anglophone discourse of LGBTIQ identities recognized
    by the state and the development sector, on one hand, and forms of
    gender/sexual variance that are positioned as relatively regional or
    local on the other.

- abstract: Drawing upon an ongoing ethnography with low-wage migrant
    workers in Singapore, this article builds on the theoretical
    framework of the culture-centered approach (CCA) to explore the
    experiences of the workers amid COVID-19 outbreaks in dormitories
    housing them. The CCA foregrounds the interplays of communicative
    and material inequalities, suggesting that the erasure of
    infrastructures of voices among the margins reproduces and
    circulates unhealthy structures that threaten the health and
    well-being of the working classes. The voices of the low-wage
    migrant workers who participated in this study document the
    challenges with poor housing, poor sanitation, and food insecurity
    that are compounded with the absence of information and voice
    infrastructures. Amid the everyday threats to health and well-being
    that are generated by neoliberal reforms across the globe, the
    hyper-precarious conditions of migrant work rendered visible by the
    trajectories of COVID-19 call for structurally transformative
    futures that are anchored in the voices of workers at the margins of
    neoliberal economies.

- abstract: Abstract This article considers the way the outbreak of
    coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown have egregiously impeded the
    intimate life practices of Kotis, people who possess a distinct
    gender-variant identity in India. The Kotis, who subsist mostly on
    begging or sex work through cross-dressing, counter the hegemonic
    heteronormative 'bodyscape' that fetishizes bodily differences and
    reinforces normative intimate practices. Using narratives and
    documentary evidence on their lives, this article elaborates how
    Koti livelihoods and the intimate practices circumambient of such
    livelihoods are withering away because of the pandemic. Tragically
    today, they are branded as 'corona transmitters', and their intimate
    practices are stigmatised as 'infectious'. A restraint on their
    physical movement and gathering in public spaces due to the pandemic
    has ramifications not only for their livelihood, but also for their
    intimate practices and identity assertions.

- abstract: During the current pandemic, gender non-conforming
    communities (GNCs) in India have been engaging themselves as
    critical citizens through a demonstration of civic engagement and
    social responsibility. This paper, based on narratives, documentary
    evidence and media reports, demonstrates how GNC volunteers are
    playing a decisive role in accentuating the virtues of
    representative democracy by serving as 'monitorial citizens' in
    India. It also considers the social dynamics involved in GNC people
    becoming 'monitorial' in a heteronormative society. This means
    consolidation of their community network and its strategic and
    instrumental use not just to serve their community, but also a
    diverse cis-gendered population consisting of migrants, homeless,
    marginalized, and the poor. In this process, they are creating a
    shared sense of belonging, based on mutual experiences of
    discrimination, with other communities that are not categorized as
    gender non-conforming. Their actions also challenge the normative
    standards set by mainstream society and create an alternative to
    existing power hierarchies by capsizing the heteronormative 'gaze'.

- abstract: The most destructive effects of Covid-19 in India have not
    been the result of the disease, but the nature of the government
    response. The most stringent lockdown in the world destroyed the
    economy and forced millions into poverty and hunger, but did not
    control virus transmission. The resurgence of disease as
    restrictions were lifted and the continued economic distress point
    to ten major features of state response that ensured these
    unfortunate outcomes.

- abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed massive failures of
    governance at the global and national levels. Global health
    governance failed rapidly, with action quickly becoming nationally
    based, uncoordinated, and often zero-sum. However, domestic health
    governance also often fared very poorly, even in some of the
    wealthiest countries, which were ostensibly best-prepared to deal
    with a pandemic. Why? We argue that this reflects the inherent
    pathologies of the shift from 'government to governance' and of the
    'regulatory state' it had spawned. This has resulted in the
    hollowing-out of effective state capacities, the dangerous diffusion
    of responsibility, and de facto reliance on ad hoc emergency
    measures to contain crises. We demonstrate this through a detailed
    case study of Britain, where regulatory governance and corporate
    outsourcing failed miserably, contrasting this with the experience
    of South Korea, where the regulatory state form was less well
    established and even partially reversed.

- abstract: The targeted public distribution system (TPDS) of
    India---world's largest food safety-net program---has a reputation
    for poor targeting, rampant corruption and low impact. Five states
    of India modified TPDS by reducing targeting, lowering grain prices
    to Rs.1--3 per kg and tightening its administration. This paper
    assesses the impact of changes in the TPDS on household food
    consumption using data from a repeated cross-section of Indian
    households from five rounds of representative consumption surveys
    between 1993--1994 and 2009--2010. We use the
    Difference-in-Difference (DID) method to identify the policy impact,
    first on consumption of food-grains, and second, on food
    expenditure. We find that modifications in TPDS led not only to an
    increase in the purchase of subsidized grains from fair-price shops,
    but also to diversification of the food basket of poor households.
    We also find evidence for reduction in the diversion of grains from
    TPDS to the open market in reform states. Finally, we present
    suggestive evidence that a food policy reform is likely to fail if
    price and targeting policy components are not accompanied by
    effective administrative measures to reduce corruption and improve
    the logistics of subsidized food distribution. These are important
    findings for India's own National Food Security Act (NFSA) and for
    other food safety-net programs throughout the developing world.

- abstract: To help tackle the spread of COVID-19 a range of
    surveillance technologies -- smartphone apps, facial recognition and
    thermal cameras, biometric wearables, smart helmets, drones, and
    predictive analytics -- have been rapidly developed and deployed.
    Used for contact tracing, quarantine enforcement, travel permission,
    social distancing/movement monitoring, and symptom tracking, their
    rushed rollout has been justified by the argument that they are
    vital to suppressing the virus, and civil liberties have to be
    sacrificed for public health. I challenge these contentions,
    questioning the technical and practical efficacy of surveillance
    technologies, and examining their implications for civil liberties,
    governmentality, surveillance capitalism, and public health.

- abstract: "COVID-19 is proving to be the long awaited 'big one': a
    pandemic capable of bringing societies and economies to their knees.
    There is an urgent need to examine how COVID-19 -- as a health and
    development crisis - unfolded the way it did it and to consider
    possibilities for post-pandemic transformations and for rethinking
    development more broadly. Drawing on over a decade of research on
    epidemics, we argue that the origins, unfolding and effects of the
    COVID-19 pandemic require analysis that addresses both structural
    political-economic conditions alongside far less ordered, 'unruly'
    processes reflecting complexity, uncertainty, contingency and
    context-specificity. This structural-unruly duality in the
    conditions and processes of pandemic emergence, progression and
    impact provides a lens to view three key challenge areas. The first
    is how scientific advice and evidence are used in policy, when
    conditions are rigidly 'locked in' to established power relations
    and yet so uncertain. Second is how economies function, with the
    COVID-19 crisis having revealed the limits of a conventional model
    of economic growth. The third concerns how new forms of politics can
    become the basis of reshaped citizen-state relations in confronting
    a pandemic, such as those around mutual solidarity and care.
    COVID-19 demonstrates that we face an uncertain future, where
    anticipation of and resilience to major shocks must become the core
    problematic of development studies and practice. Where mainstream
    approaches to development have been top down, rigid and orientated
    towards narrowly-defined economic goals, post-COVID-19 development
    must have a radically transformative, egalitarian and inclusive
    knowledge and politics at its core."

- abstract: Post-independence Africa saw a rise in authoritarianism;
    however, this political system was led by malevolent autocrats who
    ruled with an iron fist, accumulating absolute power, redirecting
    wealth to small coalitions, and passing policies favouring only a
    few. However, these ideals and principles have evolved over the past
    decade, noticeably in countries like Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Uganda,
    introducing a different variant of authoritarianism, known as
    "developmental authoritarianism." Ostensibly inspired by the Chinese
    authoritarian developmentalism model, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Uganda
    should be studied to comprehend the objectives and functionality of
    this school of thought. In these East African cases, this article
    scrutinises whether the culture ostensibly cultivates the sacrifice
    of individual liberties for common objectives, countering liberal
    principles while promoting economic prosperity and development. The
    political leadership of these political systems is pivotal in
    achieving socioeconomic development in Africa. Benevolent autocrats
    like Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, President Paul Kagame, and President
    Yoweri Museveni, among others in Africa, are critical in bolstering
    economic growth and ensuring state development for their countries.
    However, achieving rapid economic growth and robust state
    development comes at the cost of forgone civil liberties, as human
    rights violations persist in these countries. Notably, the culture
    within these countries fosters severed liberties for the common
    good. This article investigates this fairly new political system in
    Africa, how it is used by these East African regions, and the
    ostensible African culture which subdues many into accepting
    illiberal practices for ostensible broad-based economic prosperity
    and state development.

    economic consequences of the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus,
    setting it in the context of a Gramscian interregnum. First, the
    dismantling of the triangular articulation of the world market that
    characterized the decade before 2008 is examined. Second, the global
    protest wave and the electoral shifts observed since 2010 are
    interpreted as evidence of a crisis of neoliberal hegemony.
    Together, the economic and hegemonic crises represent the
    interregnum. Last, it is argued that the fight against the pandemic
    may lead to the overcoming of neoliberalism.

- abstract: How a country responds to a rupture such as the COVID-19
    pandemic can be revelatory of its governance. Governance entails not
    only the exercise but also the constitution of authority. The
    pandemic response thus presents a real-world disruption to verify or
    problematize some truisms about national governance and produce
    novel comparisons and insights. We present a comparative analysis
    across four established democratic nation-states. First, we identify
    concerns of relevance for national pandemic responses and map them
    to state characteristics. Next, we conduct thematic analyses of
    recent ruptures in India, the United States, Sweden and Norway, to
    form a baseline of truisms about governance responses to frontier
    moments such as this pandemic, and hypothesize their relative
    propensities across the concerns. We then compile comparative data
    on emergent pandemic responses during the first 90 days of
    respective, temporally proximate outbreaks. This combination enables
    us to link response characteristics to national propensities across
    the relevant concerns. We identify similarities and differences
    between what the pandemic responses reveal and the truisms of
    scholarship about the four countries state characteristics. We argue
    that ruptures in democratic governance contexts embody temporally
    discontiguous and country-specific patterns. They are conjunctures
    of particular possibilities for bounded reconfiguration. Such
    reconfiguration can intensify or shift the course of what the state
    is becoming. We argue that in our cases it accelerates shifts to
    authoritarianism (India and the United States), raises stark
    questions of national identity (Norway and Sweden) and underscores
    tensions between the reemergence of welfare states and the global
    project of neoliberalism. By revealing what sort of rules show
    resurgence across ruptures, our comparative analysis deepens a
    timely understanding of punctuated politics of reconfiguration of
    authority.

- abstract: India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is part of a worldwide
    wave of strong 'populist' leaders who have emerged in the context of
    the crisis of neoliberalism, and among whose appeal is their claims
    to put their economies back on a growth trajectory by the
    authoritarian implementation of core neoliberal reforms. Noting its
    relative lack in relevant literatures, I build an account of 'strong
    leadership', based on Modi's record in government, as it mediates
    between 'authoritarian populism' and 'neoliberal restoration'. Such
    leadership, I show, is based on a serial creation of a
    'people/enemy' divide in society, mobilising this division to win
    large electoral mandates, and using and using such mandates in turn
    to support authoritarian projects of majoritarianism and of
    neoliberal economic reforms. Modi has drawn on leadership practices
    contextual to postcolonial India, such as earlier iterations under
    Nehru and Indira Gandhi. However, his project has moved beyond these
    earlier iterations of 'strong leader' politics into an authoritarian
    and, in some crucial ways, fascist directions. Coming to power to
    solve the 'crisis of neoliberalism', it has made most advance in
    instituting a majoritarian Hindu nation, first constructing it as a
    pre-figurative community, and now giving it shape as constitutional
    fact. These new modes of 'embodying the nation' and exercising
    spatial control have been made possible through the domination of
    media and social media that create serial 'radical exclusions' of
    nominated 'enemies of the people'. However, his project of joining
    an authoritarian restoration of some key neoliberal policy themes
    with the pursuit of a Hindu nation is limited by how much contention
    can be contained within the 'people-enemy' frame, and by changes in
    other enabling conditions of international support and social media
    domination.

- abstract: The news is old -- neoliberalism is dead for good, but this
    time, even Financial Times knows it. Obituaries claim that it had
    died from the coronavirus, as the state, not the markets, have had
    to save both the people and the economy. The argument of the article
    is that these academic and media interpretations of 'emergency
    Keynesianism' misidentify neoliberalism with its anti-statist
    rhetoric. For neoliberalism is, and has always been, about 'the free
    market and the strong state'. In fact, rather than waning in the
    face of the coronavirus crisis, neoliberal states around the world
    are using the ongoing 'war against the virus' to strengthen their
    right-hand grip on the conditions of the working classes.

- abstract: In this essay we seek to trouble the easy conflation of
    sexual and economic liberalism in contemporary India. Even as new
    regimes of consumption connect narratives of economic freedom with
    sexual freedom, there remain many constraints on women's ability to
    express sexuality in creative and autonomous, rather than obligatory
    and scripted, ways. Focusing on two recent episodes -- proposals to
    ban cheerleaders in cricket performances in Maharashtra and the
    vigilante attacks in pubs and streets on women in southern Karnataka
    -- we analyse reactions across varied political positions, including
    those of official women's organizations. Our goal is to bring
    theories of spectatorship to bear on understanding the politics of
    these episodes. We emphasize distinctions between the contexts of
    performance and reception, and argue that women's attire and conduct
    can be read in heterogeneous ways. Our aim is to seek a more
    effective feminist response to such controversies, and to articulate
    a vision of sexual autonomy that is not necessarily linked to
    hegemonic consumer behaviour.

- abstract: The 2018 Indian Supreme Court judgement decriminalizing
    homosexuality has been marked as a "decolonial act." Section 377,
    which criminalized homosexuality, was a colonial law introduced by
    the British in India, which the postcolonial state maintained till
    2018. The judgement may be "decolonial" in intent, but there are
    other simultaneous processes at play which are not so decolonial in
    praxis; this essay argues these processes are colonialism,
    brahminical supremacy, and Islamophobia. Caste-based violence is
    integral to Hinduism and intertwined with other matrices of
    oppression, making caste foundational to any claims of Hinduism as
    queer, trans and gender nonconforming friendly. Studying recent
    Hindu nationalist responses in favour of decriminalization of
    homosexuality in India, this essay traces how the Hindu Right
    deploys queerness to propagate its Islamophobic, casteist, and
    homohindunationalist agendas. The essay argues decolonizing the law,
    state, and sexuality would also mean annihilating caste and
    brahminical structures.
