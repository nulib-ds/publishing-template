abstract: |
    The institutionalization of transgender studies as a field comes just as the academy has decided that “fields” are a less relevant and more cumbersome aspect of professional academic organization that prevents the kind of theoretical and empirical work needed to make scholarship relevant to contemporary society. A number of areas of intellectual inquiry have, accordingly, shifted to a “post-discipline” model of academic organization. But what would it mean to think of transgender studies as a post-discipline? First, it would mean a turn away from a focus on field-building within the humanities. Second, it would mean insisting upon transdisciplinary collaboration despite the academy’s failure to encourage such collaboration. But perhaps most importantly, it would mean a turn *toward* addressing the material conditions of transgender existence and the issues transgender people face in the world. In short, it would mean reorienting ourselves toward an *applied transgender studies*.

- abstract: In conversation with Emmett Harsin Drager and Andrea Long
    Chu's "After Trans Studies," this collaborative essay also turns to
    questions of field formation and the ethos of trans studies.
    Situating the growth of the field in the material conditions of
    precarity under which trans knowledge-workers work, the authors
    argue that trans studies can't be "over" because, in fact, it isn't
    yet here. Rather than viewing this as only a dismal proposition,
    however, they insist that the tenuousness of trans studies provides
    us with the opportunity to envision and enact more sustaining ways
    of being "in the field."

- abstract: This roundtable considers trans theory's status as a site of
    thinking racialization, empire, political economy, and materiality
    in the current historical, institutional, and political moment. We
    ask, what does it mean to think trans in a time of crisis?, and what
    is the place of critique in a crisis?, acknowledging that global
    crises are not insulated from trans, and trans is not insulated from
    the world. This roundtable looks to materialist formations to think
    trans now, including a new materialism premised on thinking about
    trans embodiment outside of trans as subject position, the
    materialism of objects and commodities, and a historical materialism
    shaped by queer of color critique.

- abstract: This article presents a mixed methods content analysis of
    autobiographies by transgender autistics (autistic-trans). It
    incorporates books, anthologies, poems, and prose, including
    self-published, grey, and professionally published texts up to June
    2020. Seventy-one English-language texts in 15 separate books were
    identified. The first was published in 2003 and the majority have
    been published since 2013. The most common themes explored
    individuals' experience of autism diagnosis, community, coming out
    (as trans), and gender, with many speaking of being nonbinary,
    genderless, or using autism-specific genders (e.g., autigender).
    Notably, these themes, which exemplify those that are important to
    autistic-trans writers, contrast markedly with the topics of most
    academic work on autistic-trans lives. These experiences were
    explored in the context of the double empathy problem, the looping
    effect, gender performance, and trans healthcare access. These
    findings can be used to inform future research on the
    transgender-autistic community.

- abstract: The essay thinks radically differently about the concepts of
    black and trans\*. Trans\* and black thus denote poetic,
    para-ontological forces that are only tangentially, and ultimately
    arbitrarily, related to bodies said to be black or transgender. That
    is to say, they are differently inflected names for an anoriginal
    lawlessness that marks an escape from confinement and a besidedness
    to ontology. Manifesting in the modern world differently as race and
    gender fugitivity, black and trans\*, though pointed at by bodies
    that identify as black or trans\*, precede and provide the
    foundational condition for those fugitive identificatory
    demarcations. The author seeks to demonstrate the ways in which
    trans\* is black and black is trans\*. In what ways, and to what
    extent, is there a "blackness" present within "trans\*-ness," and
    vice versa? What is the effect of these analytics? This essay hopes
    to address these questions but also leave them suspended in
    black/trans\* liminality.

- abstract: This conversation meditates on the ways in which Black
    Feminism and Trans Feminism relate to one another, how they speak to
    and supplement one another, and how they are in fact constitutive.
    Considering that Black feminism, historically, has attempted to
    interrogate the capaciousness of the very term "woman" and to
    gender, if you will, an androcentric "Blackness," one might say, as
    Che Gossett has said, that Black feminism is "always already trans."
    The present conversation, taking place via e-mail from October of
    2015 to October of 2017, is a dialogue conducted by Black feminist
    scholars that deeply engages prevailing notions of Blackness and
    transness, and radicalizes how these are understood with respect to
    feminism. In short, it is a conversation in Black, in trans, in
    feminism, and offers different conceptions of how Black and trans
    and feminism work with and through one another.

- abstract: "I argue for a new model of public scholarship in the field
    of communication---one that defines public-ness not in terms of
    publicity but in terms of the public good. Synthesizing work on
    public scholarship in communication and sociology with participatory
    action research frameworks, I narrate my experiences of fieldwork in
    the U.S. transgender rights movement. In doing so, I demonstrate the
    reciprocal benefits of fieldwork for both scholars and the publics
    served by social justice organizations. I further discuss the depths
    of public engagement permitted and achieved via fieldwork relative
    to publicity-centered scholarship. Finally, I address the ideal role
    of public engagement as scholars: contributing specialized skills
    and knowledge toward the mitigation of social problems. Ultimately,
    I argue, if a scholar publicly engages in issues of social justice
    without orienting their public work toward alleviating injustice,
    then they are actively sustaining the systems of oppression they
    benefit from researching."

- abstract: This roundtable began as the first panel of the
    International Communication Association dedicated exclusively to
    transgender studies. The articles of the panel investigated various
    domains of mediated representation, from television to newspapers to
    online pornography to Tumblr blogs. The differences in media,
    methods, and theoretical frameworks across the articles allowed for
    the panel to cover a broad swath of transgender representation in
    the current media environment. At the same time, their intersections
    allowed for conversation to move beyond theoretical understandings
    of media representation inherited from feminist and LGB studies to
    think about what transgender-specific modes of representation may
    be, how they differ from other modes of representation, and how the
    consequences of these transgender-specific modes may also,
    therefore, differ. After some time away to reflect, the panelists
    sat back down to answer important questions about how their work
    pushes both the theory and the practice of transgender media
    representation forward.

- abstract: Previous research suggests that transgender men and women
    are more likely to experience body dissatisfaction and disordered
    eating. Few studies have, however, investigated the manner in which
    body dissatisfaction and eating behavior are affected by the gender
    affirmation process. To address this issue, semi-structured
    interviews were conducted with transgender men and women (\*N\* =
    22) recruited from British support groups. Participants were aged
    19--71 years. Participant sexuality included heterosexual,
    homosexual, pansexual, and asexual orientations and all participants
    identified themselves as white. For both transgender men and women,
    analyses revealed a shift from a focus on psychological wellbeing in
    the early stages of gender affirmation to physical wellbeing in the
    later stages. While body dissatisfaction appeared to dissipate as
    gender affirmation progressed, a common theme across the gender
    affirmation process was that both transgender men and women engaged
    in risky behaviors related to transforming body shape and size.
    Findings highlight the need to consider the influence of gender
    affirmation when researching the interconnections between attitudes,
    behavior, and emotions relating to gender identity.

- abstract: "\\\"How can social science make itself relevant to the
    intractable problems facing humanity in the twenty-first century?
    The social sciences are under threat from two main sources. One is
    external, reflected in a global university crisis that imposes the
    marketization of higher education on the ancient practice of
    scholarship. The other, internal threat is social science's
    withdrawal from publicly-engaged teaching and research into the
    protective bunker of disciplinarity. In articulating a vision for
    the public role of social science in the twenty-first century, John
    Brewer argues that these threats also constitute an opportunity for
    a new public social science to emerge, confident in its public value
    and fully engaged with the future of humanity in its teaching,
    research and civic responsibilities, while also remaining committed
    to science. The argument is presented in the form of an interpretive
    essay: thought-provoking, forward-looking, and challenging to
    intellectual orthodoxy. It should be read and debated by all
    researchers and teachers in the social science disciplines who are
    concerned by the future of higher education and the relevance of
    their subjects to the future of humankind.\\\"--Bloomsbury

- abstract: Though many transmasculine individuals pursue pregnancy,
    childbirth, and parenthood in their lifetimes, research on the
    reproductive health needs of this population remains limited. This
    study aimed to explore the fertility intentions and desires of
    transmasculine young adults, as well as the multilevel factors that
    influence their pregnancy-related decisions. We conducted in-depth
    interviews with transmasculine young adults aged 18--29 (\*N\* = 21)
    in Boston, MA, USA between February and July of 2018. Interviews
    were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach
    involving inductive and deductive coding via a codebook applied by
    two independent coders. While many participants reported no lifetime
    desire for pregnancy, a sizable minority expressed some desire to
    become pregnant in the future. Fertility intentions were shaped by a
    range of anticipated barriers, including gender dysphoria,
    difficulty navigating gendered stereotypes about pregnancy,
    inadequate information about fertility and pregnancy for
    transmasculine individuals, and a lack of health providers with the
    training and experience to offer high-quality pregnancy-related care
    to transmasculine patients. Multilevel interventions that address
    cisnormative stigma and discrimination in reproductive health care
    settings, improve patient-provider communication, and increase
    provider fluency with transmasculine health needs are necessary to
    facilitate access to the full spectrum of fertility-related services
    among transmasculine young adults.

- abstract: This paper considers the future prospects for Critical
    Management Studies and by extension management studies more
    generally. To explore these, two frameworks from the wider social
    sciences are deployed. The anchorpoint for the discussion is Michael
    Burawoy's work distinguishing types of scholarship on the bases of
    (a) conceptions of knowledge produced by social scientists, and (b)
    different audiences for that knowledge. Critical Management Studies
    is founded on critique but its future will be determined by how it
    makes its way across Burawoy's other domains of professional, policy
    and public scholarship. To examine this, I draw on John Brewer's
    recent articulation of the 'new public social science'. Brewer's
    problem-driven, post-disciplinary approach conceives the public
    value of social science as its conservation of moral sentiments and
    sympathetic imagination towards each other as social beings, and its
    ethical concern about the humanitarian future of humankind. The new
    public social science is normative and partisan, transgressive,
    scientific, and impactful. I argue that this provides a potentially
    fruitful template to guide future management studies. This is a
    future in which Critical Management Studies -- as management
    studies' critical and emancipatory conscience -- has a central role
    to play.

- abstract: Transgender and gender non-conforming people, particularly
    communities from predominantly working class and Dalit
    (oppressed-caste) backgrounds such as kothis and hijras, were among
    those hit hardest during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The
    COVID-19 crisis was exacerbated by the policies of the Indian state,
    which demonstrate an unstable assemblage or conjuncture of
    neoliberal and developmentalist tendencies, in keeping with
    long-term systemic patterns in the region. The article situates
    Indian trans activism during the COVID-19 pandemic within the
    context of the neoliberal--developmentalist assemblage that
    characterizes governance in contemporary India and examines the
    possibilities and limitations of such activism. During the COVID-19
    crisis, trans communities and activists contest and negotiate with
    the state in variable ways, sometimes bolstering and suturing
    neoliberal and developmentalist modes of governance and sometimes
    challenging or undermining them, and even playing them against each
    other. This article traces these varied negotiations and analyzes
    how they not only enable the survival of trans people through the
    pandemic, but also demonstrate ways activists may push back against
    the state's simultaneous regulation and neglect of their
    communities.

- abstract: "We are in a time labeled the \"transgender tipping point,\" a
    period characterized by the scaling up of legal protections,
    visibility, rights, and politics centered on transgender people. The
    contemporary visual landscape is populated with the bodies of Black
    women. How does the language and discourse of the tipping point
    elide the presence of a saturation of Black bodies? In academia this
    elision has taken the shape of the expansion and
    institutionalization of transgender studies as a discipline. We are
    interested in what happens to the category of transgender as it
    becomes routed through the logics and power lines of
    institutionality and the metrics of administration. This special
    issue of TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly is the product and
    process of our attempt to think through how the institutionalization
    of transgender studies as a discipline functions as a scene of
    subjection for blackness---for Black people and places."

- abstract: With transgender rights front and center in American
    politics, media, and culture, the pervasive myth still exists that
    today's transgender children are a brand new generation--pioneers in
    a field of new obstacles and hurdles. Histories of the Transgender
    Child shatters this myth, uncovering a previously unknown
    twentieth-century history when transgender children not only existed
    but preexisted the term transgender and its predecessors, playing a
    central role in the medicalization of trans people, and all sex and
    gender. Beginning with the early 1900s when children with
    \"ambiguous\" sex first sought medical attention, to the 1930s when
    transgender people began to seek out doctors involved in altering
    children's sex, to the invention of the category gender, and finally
    the 1960s and '70s when, as the field institutionalized, transgender
    children began to take hormones, change their names, and even access
    gender confirmation, Julian Gill-Peterson reconstructs the
    medicalization and racialization of children's bodies. Throughout,
    they foreground the racial history of medicine that excludes black
    and trans of color children through the concept of gender's
    plasticity, placing race at the center of their analysis and at the
    center of transgender studies. Until now, little has been known
    about early transgender history and life and its relevance to
    children. Using a wealth of archival research from hospitals and
    clinics, including incredible personal letters from children to
    doctors, as well as scientific and medical literature, this book
    reaches back to the first half of the twentieth century--a time when
    the category transgender was not available but surely existed, in
    the lives of children and parents.

- abstract: Gender clinics engaging with pre-pubertal trans children are
    divided between those that endorse a gender affirmative approach and
    those that do not. Little evidence is available on how trans
    children experience non-affirmative gender clinics in early
    childhood. This study aimed to understand pre-pubertal trans
    children's recent experiences in non-affirmative gender clinics in
    the UK. Data focused on a cohort of trans children who socially
    transitioned under age eleven. Data were drawn from semi-structured
    qualitative interviews with ten trans children and 30 UK-based
    parents of trans children, focusing on children's pre-pubertal
    engagement with UK gender clinics. Themes are presented on 1)
    inappropriate assessment of gender; 2) trans children under
    pressure; and 3) distress and trauma in UK gender clinics. The
    article presents evidence of continued pathologisation and
    problematisation of childhood gender diversity in UK children's
    gender clinics. It demonstrates the harms pf the status quo and the
    need for systemic reform, providing modern affirmative care for
    younger trans children.

- abstract: While trans identities are typically understood through the
    distress-based concept of \*gender dysphoria\*, some trans people
    use the term \*gender euphoria\* to describe their experiences.
    Broadly defined as positive gender-related emotions, the concept has
    become more common in trans communities in recent years but has
    received little academic attention. To fill this gap, we conducted
    qualitative interviews with five trans individuals. We found that
    gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from
    affirmation of one's gender identity or expression and can include a
    wide variety of emotions and experiences. Gender euphoria can range
    from feelings of intense joy accompanying the attainment of
    milestones in gender transition through to a more consistent sense
    of calmness and relief occurring later in transition. We
    contextualize these findings within the gender minority stress model
    to explore the link between gender euphoria, dysphoria, and health
    and well-being generally. Our findings emphasize the value of
    prioritizing euphoria, happiness, and safety in gender-affirming
    care.

- abstract: In 2021, the United States experienced the most active year
    on record for anti-trans legislation. In 2022, we are witnessing the
    renewal of this legislative harassment, with increased success on
    the part of anti-trans lawmakers. When these bills are passed into
    law and, importantly, even when they are resoundingly defeated or
    fail to reach an actual vote, the harmful rhetoric and ideology that
    is attached to them reverberates throughout trans communities
    resulting in social and psychological harm for transgender,
    nonbinary, and gender diverse people. The burden of addressing and
    offsetting this harm is often placed on the shoulders of other trans
    people who serve as grassroots leaders in their communities. This
    article argues that while this support is lifesaving for individual
    trans people, transformative change requires an increase in
    \*structural competency\* in our mainstream social institutions, and
    makes the case for applied trans studies as a pathway to that end.

    force trans studies against queer theory: Because queer theory is
    the institutional context through which trans studies is invited
    into the university, it is also the containing ideological
    architecture against which trans studies must articulate itself.
    Trans studies is therefore pressed \"against\" queer theory as a
    discursive surface in a manner that limits it from being able to
    exit this disciplinary scenario."

- abstract: This essay maps the epistemological terrain trans\* studies
    may face as it is widely incorporated into queer studies programs,
    often housed within women's studies departments. Over the past two
    decades, queer studies and women's studies have rapidly
    professionalized, producing new modes of disciplinary power that may
    seek to either include or cite trans\* studies, often without fully
    welcoming its specific material and political investments. Under
    such conditions, trans\* studies may find itself heard largely as a
    but---an epistemic blockage, a distraction from proper objects, a
    hindrance to customary methods---that must be disciplined.

- abstract: "This essay considers the utility of research questions that
    articulate aspects of transgender lives to the nontransgender
    populations with whom they share a wide range of bodily and lived
    experience. By foregrounding transgender's instability as a research
    variable, the authors argue for more precise methodological
    orientations in trans research, particularly regarding gender and
    sexual orientation. Drawing on their own data with trans men whose
    sexual attractions have shifted during transition, they argue
    against unidimensional interpretations of this experience. Feminists
    and critical race scholars suggest that race and gender frequently
    function as \"proxies\": variables that reduce the complexities of
    biosocial bodily experience to more quantifiable forms of data. The
    authors argue that much of the research conducted with transgender
    persons suffers from similar reductions, narrowing the
    epistemological frameworks through which these populations are
    subsequently investigated and understood. By contrasting the
    National Transgender Discrimination Survey's focus on the measurable
    experience of discrimination with research that makes broader claims
    regarding \"the transgender population,\" the essay invites
    researchers to develop a set of best practices that resemble those
    of feminist science studies scholars."

    it mean for trans people to show up for one another, to care deeply
    for one another? How have failures of care shaped trans lives? What
    care practices have trans subjects and communities cultivated in the
    wake of widespread transphobia and systemic forms of trans
    exclusion? Trans Care is a critical intervention in how care labor
    and care ethics have been thought, arguing that dominant modes of
    conceiving and critiquing the politics and distribution of care
    entrench normative and cis-centric familial structures and gendered

- abstract: "Invisible Lives is the first scholarly study of
    transgendered people---cross-dressers, drag queens and
    transsexuals---and their everyday lives. Through combined
    theoretical and empirical study, Viviane K. Namaste argues that
    transgendered people are not so much produced by medicine or
    psychiatry as they are erased, or made invisible, in a variety of
    institutional and cultural settings. Namaste begins her work by
    analyzing two theoretical perspectives on transgendered
    people---queer theory and the social sciences---displaying how
    neither of these has adequately addressed the issues most relevant
    to sex change: everything from employment to health care to identity
    papers. Namaste then examines some of the rhetorical and semiotic
    inscriptions of transgendered figures in culture, including studies
    of early punk and glam rock subcultures, to illustrate how the
    effacement of transgendered people is organized in different
    cultural sites. Invisible Lives concludes with new research on some
    of the day-to-day concerns of transgendered people, offering case
    studies in violence, health care, gender identity clinics, and the
    law."

- abstract: Some estimates place more than 500,000 trans people in the
    South, making the region home to over one-third of the US trans
    population. A region with more anti-trans policies and fewer
    protections for trans people than other areas of the country, the
    South has become a kind of test kitchen for conservative attempts to
    enact anti-trans legislation through state and local governments.
    These policies are aimed at restricting trans people's access to
    healthcare, education, recreation, accommodations, and public
    facilities like restrooms, bathing facilities, and emergency
    housing.This trend peaked last year, as lawmakers around the
    country, yet concentrated in the South, proposed more anti-trans
    legislation than in any other year on record. States across the
    region have also renewed their efforts at legislating so-called
    "religious exemptions,"religious exemptions, attempting to implement
    pathways for faith-based discrimination against trans people in
    state-funded service agencies and organizations. In some cases,
    legislators went so far as to introduce anticipatory restrictions
    that block and in some cases punish local officials who enact their
    own protections for trans people in their communities.In most cases
    during the 2021 legislative sessions, local organizers across the
    region blocked these proposals. Yet, we are already witnessing the
    renewal of this legislative harassment in 2022. Whether they become
    bills or not, these proposals contribute to a hostile social climate
    for trans people. Trans youth are especially vulnerable to this
    legislative harassment, and their experiences of identity related
    stress are more likely to contribute to increased anxiety,
    depression, and suicidality. In this presentation, Johnson makes the
    case for using community-based research to build structural
    competency among grassroots, non-profit, and public service
    organizations who are developing interventions to support trans
    youth in the South.Austin H Johnson, PhD is an Assistant Professor
    in the Department of Sociology at Kenyon College and director of the

    Southern Equality.

- abstract: "preface For some time now feminists have struggled with the
    challenges that transgender subjectivity brings to sexuality and
    gender binaries, especially in the understanding of the category
    \\\"woman.\\\" There have been several compilations that have touched on
    the subject, such as Transgender History, the Transgender Studies
    Reader, and Transgender Rights, as well as special issues of a range
    of social science and interdisciplinary journals. Queer historian,
    writer, and filmmaker Susan Stryker has been on the forefront of
    such efforts, deftly linking participants in exchanges over common
    questions and issues as the editor for her transgender anthology and
    transgender special issues for the interdisciplinary journals---the
    GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies and Women's Studies
    Quarterly. In her introduction to the Transgender Studies Reader,
    Stryker draws our attention to the lack of contri butions from
    people of color and the urgent need for a \\\"transgender stud ies\\\"
    that more adequately and carefully engaged the \\\"complex interplay
    between race, ethnicity, and transgender phenomenon.\\\"1 Bobby Noble
    makes a similar point in the review essay, \\\"'My Own Set of Keys':
    Medita tions on Transgender, Scholarship, Belonging,\\\" with which we
    begin this special issue. While providing an overview of some of the
    field-defining books that have been published over the past decade,
    he comments also on some of the limitations of a predominantly white
    referent for transgender subjectivity as currently represented in
    critical theory. Noble also points to a burgeoning set of material
    that is beginning to emerge from scholars of color on this topic
    grounded in a queer of color critique. We see this special issue of
    Feminist Studies as in part responding to Striker's and Noble's
    calls and also as offering a series of interdisciplinary
    interventions that engage the varied intersections and mutual
    constitu tiveness of transgender and critical race theory. This Race
    and Trans gender Studies special issue, then, asks that we think not
    only about the 247 248 Preface impact of race on transgender theory
    but also challenges those of us who work within critical race theory
    to more fully consider how our studies of racialized communities
    would be different if we put transgender subjects at the center of
    our work, especially in how we define women of color. The issue
    opens up spaces for considering a variety of themes including racial
    and ethnic identification and cross-identification in gender perform
    ance, strategies of belonging and kinship, racial implications of
    media representations of transgender subjects, transgender politics
    of location, subjugated knowledges, and histories---to name a few.
    Following Noble's review essay is Emily Skidmore's prize-winning
    article, \\\"Constructing the 'Good Transsexual': Christine Jorgensen,
    Whiteness, and Heteronormativity in the Mid-Twentieth-Century
    Press.\\\" In this article, selected as the 2008 Feminist Studies
    awardee for the best article by a graduate student, Skidmore
    deconstructs the whiteness of familiar transgender icons through her
    reassessment of the twentieth-century's most famous U.S. transsexual
    representative. Jorgensen created a media splash when in 1952 she
    traveled to Denmark for sex reassignment surgery (SRS). The story of
    an ex-GI turned beauty queen set off a media frenzy that established
    Jorgensen as an iconographic figure in U.S. transgender history,
    helping to create what Skidmore calls \\\"the good transsexual\\\" in
    the mainstream imagination. Skidmore contrasts Jorgensen's initial
    public acclaim with that greeting the lesser-known Delisa Newton, an
    African American transwoman who was featured on the April 1966 cover
    of Sepia magazine and whose autobiography was the subject of a
    two-part series featured in the magazine. Jorgensen's early 1950s'
    story was seized on by a white mainstream media as symbolic of the
    triumph of science---in this case enabling the emergence of a
    normative white \\\"bombshell\\\" from the form of a male army file
    clerk. Jorgensen was later vilified by this same press for not being
    a \\\"real\\\" woman, as the \\\"limits\\\" of her initial SRS became known.
    A decade later, Newton's story appeared in the African American
    press and print popular culture magazines and mainstream tabloid
    newspapers. Although Newton's SRS was far more complete than
    Jorgensen's initial treatment, the \\\"real\\\" woman Newton represented
    was African American and thus not deemed\\..."

- abstract: Race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of
    classification in technical infrastructures-from the passport to
    social media. Facial analysis technologies are particularly
    pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new
    technical systems. What facial analysis technologies can do is
    determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. In
    this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race
    and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for
    facial analysis. We found that the majority of image databases
    rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities
    are defined. Further, when they are annotated with race and gender
    information, database authors rarely describe the process of
    annotation. Instead, classifications of race and gender are
    portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. We discuss
    the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature
    of race and gender. We posit that the lack of critical engagement
    with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. We
    conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the
    histories of classification inherently embedded into race and
    gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such
    classifications.

- abstract: This article argues that activist claims about the erasure
    of transgender people in public health settings and research studies
    obscure a profusion of trans- and gender-nonconforming identities,
    embodiments, and terminology in public health contexts. Using the
    concept of a "transgender matrix," this work explains how
    proliferating transgender imaginaries result in differing
    conceptualizations of sex, gender, sexuality, race, and culture that
    resonate with similarly variable public health research
    categorization practices. Demographic categories are double-edged
    swords in that they are necessary for the redirection of resources
    toward socially marginalized people; at the same time, they often
    constitute the conditions of containment of these same people.
    Drawing on de Certeau's concept of a tactic, this article proposes a
    mode of evasion through the mobilization of alternate classificatory
    schemas based on interrelational race- and class-based categorical
    imaginaries. This is exemplified by an ethnographically documented
    account of the Trans-health Information Project (TIP), a federally
    funded public health program. TIP created nonstandard safer-sex
    outreach packets that employed classificatory mobility in an ongoing
    process of adaptation and change, mutating in response to specific
    racial, ethnic, and class-based differences through the use of local
    vernaculars. This tactical maneuver temporarily circumnavigated
    administrative capture.

- abstract: The story of Christine Jorgensen, Americas first prominent
    transsexual, famously narrated trans embodiment in the postwar era.
    Her celebrity, however, has obscured other mid-century trans
    narratives-ones lived by African Americans such as Lucy Hicks
    Anderson and James McHarris. Their erasure from trans history masks
    the profound ways race has figured prominently in the construction
    and representation of transgender subjects. C. Riley Snorton
    identifies multiple intersections between blackness and transness
    from the mid-nineteenth century to present-day anti-black and
    anti-trans legislation and violence. Drawing on a deep and varied
    archive of materials-early sexological texts, fugitive slave
    narratives, Afro-modernist literature, sensationalist journalism,
    Hollywood films-Snorton attends to how slavery and the production of
    racialized gender provided the foundations for an understanding of
    gender as mutable. In tracing the twinned genealogies of blackness
    and transness, Snorton follows multiple trajectories, from the
    medical experiments conducted on enslaved black women by J. Marion
    Sims, the father of American gynecology,to the negation of blackness
    that makes transnormativity possible. Revealing instances of
    personal sovereignty among blacks living in the antebellum North
    that were mapped in terms of cross dressingand canonical black
    literary works that express black mens access to the female within,
    he concludes with a reading of the fate of Phillip DeVine, who was
    murdered alongside Brandon Teena in 1993, a fact omitted from the
    film Boys Dont Cry out of narrative convenience.

- abstract: "Welcome to TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly, which we
    intend to be the journal of record for the rapidly consolidating
    interdisciplinary field of transgender studies. Although the field
    is only now gaining a foothold in the academy, the term transgender
    has a long history that reflects multiple, sometimes overlapping,
    sometimes even contested meanings. For some, it marks various forms
    of gender crossing; for others, it signals ways of occupying genders
    that confound the gender binary. For some, it confers the
    recognition necessary for identity-based rights claims; for others,
    it is a tool to critically explore the distribution of inequality.
    The term transgender, then, carries its own antinomies: Does it help
    make or undermine gender identities and expressions? Is it a way of
    being gendered or a way of doing gender? Is it an identification or
    a method? A promise or a threat? Although we retain transgender in
    the full, formal title of this journal, we invite you to imagine the
    T in TSQ as standing in for whatever version of trans- best suits
    you --- and we imagine many of our readers, like us, will move back
    and forth among several of them. We call your attention as well to
    our use of the asterisk (symbol of the open-ended search) in the
    journal's logo, our hopefully not-too-obscure gesture toward the
    inherently unfinishable combinatorial work of the trans- prefix.
    Whatever your critical, political, or personal investment in
    particular trans- terminologies, we hope that you will find --- or
    make --- an intellectual home for yourself here.1"

The field of communication first began to cohere in the 20th century as thinkers across several established fields and scholarly traditions began applying their respective theoretical assumptions and methodological tools to the same broad set of social questions. Scholars like economist Harold Innis, literary critic Marshall McLuhan, philosopher Theodor Adorno, political scientist Harold Lasswell, psychologist Carl Hovland, and sociologists Herbert Blumer, Paul Lazarsfeld, and Robert Merton converged to study the then-new mass media of radio and, later, television (Herbst 2008). Their new intellectual program was held loosely together by questions about these time- and space-warping technologies and the widespread effects they were having (or might come to have) on every domain of the social world (Peters 1993). Despite their profound intellectual differences (and different departmental homes within the university), these and other scholars eventually established an interdisciplinary core of theories and concepts around which a new field began to orbit as scholars debated these competing explanations for important social phenomena (Schramm 1983). Eventually, they went on to formally come together in newly founded schools and departments of communication at universities across the world. Yet, even as this new field institutionalized, communication scholars struggled to define what *exactly* it was they studied and what held them together as a cognizable discipline (Herbst 2009; Peters 1993; Waisbord 2019).

Transgender studies has faced similar struggles to define itself as a field. Transgender studies emerged in two distinct waves defined by different scholarly paradigms (Schilt and Lagos 2017). The first paradigm, which sociologists Kristen Schilt and Danya Lagos (2017, 426) refer to as the "gender deviance paradigm," dominated transgender studies from the 1970s through the 1990s. In this wave, trans people were treated as *objects* of study, with cisgender researchers regarding trans people as tools to test the limits of sociological theories. The second paradigm, which Schilt and Lagos (2017, 426) call the "gender difference paradigm," emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In this wave, trans people have been centered as *subjects* of study, with researchers regarding trans people's lives as "sociologically important in their own right" (Schilt and Lagos 2017, 426).

It is the emergence of this second gender difference paradigm that has given birth to what we might now refer to as transgender studies *per se*, as transgender activists and scholars have pushed back against the pathologizing lenses of earlier medical and social scientific research, as well as challenged queer and feminist theory for their inability to fully account for transgender experience (Billard and Zhang 2022; Namaste 2000; Schilt and Lagos 2017; Stryker 2004). Instead, trans scholars have sought to give voice to their own lived experiences, "engag\[ing\] in the kind of identity politics necessary to gain speaking positions within discourse" (Stryker and Aizura 2013a, 3). To this end, much early trans studies writing has taken as its central question, "what does it mean to be transgender?" Trans studies' investment in that question has been less about generating a canon of new theories than it has been about wrestling meaning over what it means to be trans away from other disciplines. And this is not an unimportant question. But its centrality has given rise to ontological and epistemological debates around the expansive and multiple meanings of the prefix *trans*- and what can and cannot be considered a transgender "object," such that it runs the risk of decentering the material conditions of transgender life (Stryker, Currah, and Moore 2008). Scholars working in transgender studies thus find themselves debating what it means to study "trans" topics and what it is that unites them into a coherent scholarly program. Like the field of communication, the field of transgender studies faces an identity crisis.

While the fields of communication and transgender studies may experience similar tensions over what defines their areas of inquiry, they have taken profoundly different approaches to resolving them. Transgender studies has sought to resolve these tensions by tightly narrowing its scope in ways that exclude topically relevant work from other disciplines, but that give greater cohesion to its theoretical and methodological approaches. Accordingly, for the last decade or two, transgender studies has been undergoing a process of institutionalization within the humanities, where it is defined by its subsidiary relationship to queer theory and, to a lesser extent, cultural studies (Keegan 2020a, 2020b; Stryker 2020). And these disciplinary efforts to establish transgender studies as a humanistic field have borne tremendous first fruits, with a prestigious cultural studies journal, several prominent book series, and a small but growing number of institutional homes.

Whereas trans studies has pursued *disciplinary* efforts, communication has sought to resolve its definitional tensions through *postdisciplinary* efforts at field-building. As former editor of the *Journal of Communication*, Silvio Waisbord (2019), writes, communication is a "post-discipline." In contrast to traditional academic fields, post-disciplines are "primarily concerned with producing knowledge about specific phenomena detached from clear-cut disciplinary allegiances," and they serve as "intellectual trading zones where scholars trained in various disciplines seek to coordinate and synthesize analytic approaches by developing common concepts, languages, and theories around specific problems and questions" (Waisbord 2019, 127). Post-disciplines are characterized by theoretical and methodological pluralism and by fluid boundaries as scholars address the multiplicity of audiences that share their empirical concerns. We can see how communication fits the post-discipline model in the disciplinary diversity of its founders (and current participants) and in its uniting focus on specific questions raised by the empirical phenomena surrounding communication technologies. Other post-disciplines---like development studies, environmental studies, and science and technology studies---anchor themselves similarly, drawing on networks of scholars archipelagated across fields of study, each with their own theories and methods, to address issues of shared pragmatic concern.

Transgender studies is not the field of communication, of course, nor should it be. But the example of communication (among other exemplary post-disciplines) shows us a different way to think about, to define, and to *do* trans studies---particularly where it concerns the field's organization and epistemological orientation. Trans studies could serve as an "intellectual trading zone" for the full diversity of interested scholars (similarly archipelagated across disciplines) to produce new visions of trans life that center on shared empirical and pragmatic questions. Trans studies could---and in our opinion, should---make camp at the intersections of humanistic, social scientific, and biomedical inquiry, incorporating critical and empirical methods from a variety of disciplines to better account for trans materialities. Yet, it has chosen not to. We argue that this choice has been made at great cost to the field and the wider trans community.

Given its opposition to medical and social scientific research---which is understandable, considering how such research has historically worked to pathologize trans people and to gatekeep their access to gender-affirming care and legal protections---trans studies has been at best ambivalent and at worst hostile toward data and empirical methods (Labuski and Keo-Meier 2015; Namaste 2000; Stryker and Aizura 2013a). This ambivalence continues even as state institutions and technologies of surveillance use data to control and discipline trans populations (Beauchamp 2019; Fischer 2019; Scheuerman et al. 2020). As anti-trans movements in the US and globally continually threaten the welfare and life chances of trans people, we contend that transgender studies must recenter the material and open itself up to the empirical.

Our vision of the field thus expands upon the existing, albeit limited, institutionalization of transgender studies in interdisciplinary humanities. We advocate for a multi-theoretical and multi-methodological post-discipline of transgender studies that affords the analytic flexibility and intellectual pluralism needed for trans studies to make itself of importance to addressing the problems of the world. But what would it mean for trans studies to establish itself as a post-discipline? First, it would mean a turn away from a focus on field-building within the humanities, opening up the field of inquiry to interested scholars approaching trans studies from a wider range of disciplinary homes. This would necessarily involve building and maintaining bridges between the hard-won humanistic disciplinary homes where trans studies ostensibly takes place and the newer spaces being carved out across the social, biomedical, and even natural sciences. Second, it would mean insisting upon transdisciplinary collaboration despite the academy's failure to encourage such collaboration. But perhaps most importantly, it would mean a turn *toward* addressing the material conditions of transgender existence and the issues transgender people face in the world (see Billard et al. 2021; Hoffmann 2022; Johnson 2022a, 2022b; Johnson, Rogers, and Taylor 2021). In short, it would mean reorienting ourselves toward an *applied transgender studies*.

In articulating a concept of applied transgender studies, we understand it as a program of research focused on identifiable and pragmatic social, cultural, and political problems of relevance to transgender people, both at the individual and collective level. Importantly, we *do not* understand applied transgender studies as a rejection of humanistic inquiry or as a turn toward social scientific inquiry. Rather, it is about building our field around a pragmatic focus on the improvement of the conditions of transgender existence---which can be achieved through humanistic work, through social scientific work, through a synthesis of humanistic and social scientific perspectives (see, for example, Labuski and Keo-Meier 2015; Singer 2015; and Thomson and King 2015), and through modes of scholarship that fall outside the humanities/social science distinction altogether (such as biomedicine; law; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \[STEM\]; etc.). At present, such work is underrepresented in the field of trans studies; yet, without generating this applied research, the laws, policies, and practices that determine the life chances of transgender people are loathe to change. This journal, and the Center for Applied Transgender Studies that publishes it, aims to facilitate this work and, in doing so, to develop a robust area of applied transgender studies.[^1]

This article, with which we open the inaugural issue of the *Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies*, lays out our vision for the field more fully. It justifies the importance of a post-disciplinary model of organization and demonstrates how applied transgender studies brings us closer to actualizing the field's promise. Finally, it calls on other trans studies scholars to join us in this intellectual and political endeavor.

## The state the field of transgender studies

Susan Stryker (2004, 212) famously described trans studies as "queer theory's evil twin." Indeed, as Stryker and other scholars (e.g., Bettcher and Gregory 2009; Keegan 2020b; Stryker 2004; 2006) have documented, trans studies has often defined itself by simultaneous kinship with and opposition to queer theory and feminist theory. As a disciplinary endeavor, trans studies struggles against the gravitational pull of queer theory that wants to subsume it as a mere extension of sexual analysis into the realm of gender (Keegan 2020a), yet at the same time it has been harshly accused by its own proponents of being little more than a repackaging of queer theory's central ideas "with the label TRANS hastily slapped over their expiration dates" (Chu and Harsin Drager 2019, 103). Moreover, as Sally Hines (2010, 6) points out, "questions around the position of trans women within feminism cut to the heart of discussions around the constitution of 'woman'." This is particularly evident in the ways trans studies challenges the core model of male--female domination that lies at the heart of much of feminist theory, while also refusing to dispense with it entirely (Billard and Zhang 2022; Billard et al. 2020; Keegan 2020b). Indeed, the question of trans people's inclusion in women's spaces has been one that transfeminists have worked diligently to unpack by insisting on the need for an intersectional perspective (Koyama 2006). The resurgence of these tensions even became the subject of the "TERF Wars" monograph of *The Sociological Review* that sought to contextualize the "debate" within and across feminist circles and highlight the relationship between trans communities and feminist social movements (Pearce, Erikainen, and Vincent 2020).

As trans studies has become more institutionalized, its relationship to the fields of queer theory and feminist theory has complicated its place within the organizational structure of the academy. As trans theorist Cáel Keegan (2020b) shrewdly notes, queer theory and women's studies have worked to coopt transgender experience for their own theoretical ends and professional advancements without attending to the specificities of transgender life and perspectives. Keegan (2020a) further argues that trans studies has been defined in opposition to queer theory because queer theory (alongside gender studies) serves as the primary institutional context through which trans studies enters the academy, and queer (and feminist) theory offers the canon of texts against which trans studies is read. However, trans studies need not (only) be defined in opposition to queer and feminist theory. This positioning is only relevant to the extent that trans studies narrowly traces its origins to debates in queer and feminist theory.

Fields are not natural things; they are constructed by the narratives that scholars craft about the history of ideas and they are enforced through disciplinary institutionalization. The narrative of transgender studies has been shaped in myriad ways by a single scholar, Susan Stryker, who is rightly credited as a (if not *the*) founding figure of the field. Through her scholarship and her herculean institutional service---co-founding *TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly* (Stryker and Currah 2014), establishing the Transgender Studies Research Cluster at the University of Arizona's Institute for LGBT Studies (Stryker 2020), organizing the first international trans studies conference, and co-editing three transgender studies readers (Stryker and Aizura 2013b; Stryker and Blackston 2022; Stryker and Whittle 2006)---she has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in the establishment and institutionalization of transgender studies as a humanistic field positioned largely in relation to queer and feminist theory. And trans studies does indeed have a rich lineage in the cultural studies of gender and sexuality (e.g., Prosser 1998; Namaste 2000, 2005; Stone 1991; Stryker 1994)---just as it has lineages in other humanistic areas of inquiry, like Black and woman of color feminisms, disability studies, Indigenous studies, postcolonial theory, etc. (Adair, Awkward-Rich, and Marvin 2020; Bey 2017; Bey and Green 2017; Malatino 2020).

But trans studies can trace its origins to debates in biomedical and social scientific inquiry, as well. Studies of trans people have been conducted, for example, by anthropologists researching Indigenous gender practices that fall outside the Western sex--gender binary (e.g., Williams 1986); by medical researchers studying treatments for transsexualism, including hormone replacement therapy and surgical interventions (e.g., Benjamin 1966); and by sociologists studying the sociocultural construction and maintenance of gender norms and categories (e.g., Garfinkel 1967); among others. The field of transgender studies has understandably disavowed much of this research for its stigmatizing and pathologizing construction of transness, for its sometimes implicit and often explicit racism, for its relationship to colonialism and global flows of capital, and for other related reasons (see, e.g., Everhart forthcoming; Gill-Peterson 2018; Irving 2009; Snorton 2017)---even if the same critiques could (and should) be made of the humanistic field of trans studies as descended from queer and feminist theory (see, e.g., Aizura et al. 2020; Ellison et al. 2017; Namaste 2009; Richardson and Meyer 2011; Snorton and Haritaworn 2013). But where relevant areas of scholarship in the humanities have been recuperated for the purposes of building up a field of trans studies, relevant areas of biomedicine and the social sciences (not to mention STEM) have been cast aside, and scholars hailing from these disciplines have, in some ways, been barred admission from "the field" (Billard 2020).

There is yet another way of thinking about and defining academic fields that may be illuminating for thinking through transgender studies: that of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's (1983, 1984, 1988, 1993; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992) field theory. Put simply, according to Bourdieu a field is a social topography, a "configuration of relations" among a set of interacting actors and institutions, which are structured by established power dynamics. In the specific context of academic fields, we can think of the set of actors (researchers, educators, administrators, editors, etc.) and institutions (professional societies, publishers, departments, schools, colleges, etc.) that occupy various positions vis-à-vis one another, each with different kinds and amounts of capital and power (Bourdieu 1988; Charle 2018). From this perspective, we can understand the field of transgender studies as being primarily defined by the following actors and institutions:

1.  the journal *TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly*, which is held to be the sole journal dedicated to trans studies, since the *International Journal of Transgender Health* (formerly the *International Journal of Transgenderism*) and *Transgender Health* are excluded from the field of interaction; 

2.  the two book series dedicated to trans studies currently published by top university presses, namely the "ASTERISK: Gender, Trans-, and All That Comes After" series from Duke University Press and the "Queer / Trans / Digital" series from New York University Press; 

3.  a small collection of institutional homes for trans studies, including the Transgender Studies Research Cluster at the University of Arizona, the Chancellor's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Transgender Studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the Chair in Transgender Studies at the University of Victoria, and (as of 2021) the Center for Applied Transgender Studies; and, finally,

4.  the network of researchers and educators who are tied up in the webs of relationality among the actors/institutions listed in the preceding three points---the vast majority of whom are defined by their precarious relationships to the academy (Adair, Awkward-Rich, and Marvin 2020).

This paucity of institutional settings for transgender studies and dearth of actors included in the field of interaction has been---in more ways than one---a significant limitation to the field.

This necessarily coarse assessment of the state of the field sets us up to think more deeply about how the field might be reconfigured in ways that will improve it. But it also does so without considering the problems of theorizing about transness with an eye toward personal scholarly achievement---rather than public service---in the face of the material circumstances most trans people face throughout the world. While we will touch upon this ethical question in passing in our later discussion of what applied transgender studies should be and do, we leave deeper consideration of this point for other work (e.g., Billard 2019).

## The postdisciplinary turn in academia

The institutionalization of transgender studies as a field comes at a strange time. It comes just as the academy, more broadly, is pushing against the limiting boundaries of "fields," as the academy has decided that "fields" are a less relevant and a more cumbersome aspect of professional academic organization that prevents the kind of theoretical and empirical work needed to make scholarship relevant to modern society. This new aversion to disciplinarity---marked by the omnipresence of "interdisciplinary" as a buzzword used to described everything from new PhD programs to departmental seminar series to individual scholars' research agendas to the journal *TSQ*---has several roots. Some of those roots relate to neoliberal discourses of "innovation," which is said to "*necessarily* occur in the spaces between" disciplines but not *within* them (Chandler 2009, 739). Others relate to the acknowledgement that the issues scholars concern themselves with are multifaceted and thus cannot be sufficiently addressed from one disciplinary perspective alone (Menand 2001).

Regardless of its motivating impulses, the contemporary academy's aversion to disciplinarity has spawned a seemingly endless list of new approaches to scholarship (most of which are difficult to distinguish from one another), including interdisciplinarity, multidisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and so on.[^2] Of these, interdisciplinarity is likely the most familiar, arguably tracing its origins to the 1920s and becoming dominant in the US academy in the 1960s (Chandler 2009; Klein 1990). By the mid-1990s, however, interdisciplinarity had become a subject of crisis among scholars, even as administrators continued to advocate for it. Competing camps emerged of those who were outright against interdisciplinary and those who were pro-interdisciplinarity but concerned that true interdisciplinarity "wouldn't be possible without strong disciplines" (Chandler 2009, 739). Still others argued that disciplines were collapsing altogether and that new organizations of knowledge were emerging in their place (Menand 2001).

While this may seem like mere semantics, we suggest that learning from this particular intellectual history is useful at a moment where trans studies has reached a zenith in popularity, especially given that this history is contemporaneous to the inception of trans studies. We are convinced by the proponents of postdisciplinarity who argue that what gives scholars unity is their emphasis on and attention to the very real problems facing modern society (e.g., Brewer 2013; Waisbord 2019). Science and technology studies scholar Mario Biagioli (2009, 821) suggests that, in many ways, postdisciplinarity offers the best of what scholarship can do:

> A positive feature of this research model is that, while prizing fine interpretive skills and the ability to make sense of new scenarios... it de‐emphasizes issues of disciplinary identity. \[A post-discipline\] employs various methodologies to analyze different \[problems\], and yet these bricolages do not seem to precipitate identity crises.

While we would contend that Biagioli's is a somewhat sanguine view of postdisciplinarity, we agree that it offers much to be desired as a mode of academic organization. In making the epistemological shift to view theories and methods as *tools* for analyzing and addressing societal problems, rather than as *products* created for disciplinary ends, postdisciplinarity creates new forms of knowledge and new relationalities among scholars. We assert that a core strength of trans studies is precisely this postdisciplinary perspective and ability, and that it could be even further strengthened with a reorientation toward applied scholarship. 

A number of areas of intellectual inquiry have already shifted to a post-discipline model of academic organization (or else were formed as post-disciplines), including communication, development studies, environmental studies, and science and technology studies, among countless others. While each of these fields tackles different subjects in different ways and for different reasons, they are united by their distinct visions of the *value* of scholarship. Here we don't mean value in the capitalist sense that often defines assessments of scholarly worth in the modern neoliberal university and justifies the defunding of the arts and humanities. Rather, these fields concern themselves with *public value*, which "is defined in terms of humanitarian futures and societal good," as they work to produce knowledge that is "of use in addressing society's problems" (Delbridge 2014, 106). 

Postdisciplinarity, then, necessarily entails political investments and ethical values. As eminent sociologist John David Brewer (2013, 201--02) writes,

> These ethical values are explicit. They are its point\... \[Postdisciplinarity's\] research and teaching agendas are designed to engage with publics, locally organic ones as well as powerful ones, privileged and poor ones, in order to involve all stakeholders affected by the "wicked problems" we are experiencing; and the scientific commitments to analysis, explanation, and understanding are matched with the desire, at best, for solutions and at least amelioration.

In short, a post-discipline approach to field-building affords the theoretical and methodological flexibility and pluralism needed for areas of inquiry to orient themselves to the identification, analysis, and, ultimately, improvement of the material conditions they study.

## Defining a prospective post-discipline of "transgender studies"

We have argued that if the field of transgender studies has been institutionalized, it has happened within the interdisciplinary humanities and that this disciplining of trans studies is not only at odds with its goals but has also limited the scope and focus of the field. We then argued for the benefits of a *postdisciplinary* approach to scholarly organization, as evidenced by a number of extant areas of academic inquiry. That then brings us to the task of outlining what a post-discipline of transgender studies would look like and detailing how a prospective *post-discipline* of transgender studies would be preferable to the currently emerging *discipline* of transgender studies.

First, a post-discipline of transgender studies must have a clear and unwavering set of political investments. Thankfully, the field has, from its outset, had a clear politics, invested as it is in work that "\[contests\] the objectification, pathologization, and exoticization of transgender lives" (Duke University Press n.d.). Yet not all scholarship about trans people, especially scholarship by interlocutors who lack lived experience or by those invested in pathologization, has met this low political bar. At the same time, trans studies has a very particular kind of politics: a *politics of theory* that concerns itself with the rectitude of critical inquiry. But what is missing from the field---and what is demanded by a post-discipline---is a *politics of everyday life* that concerns itself with "contributing our specialized skills and knowledge toward the mitigation of social problems" (Billard 2019, 3514). As the prolific sociologist and advocate for public scholarship Michael Burawoy (Burawoy et al. 2004, 104) writes, researchers must carry their scholarship "into the trenches of civil society, where publics are more visible, thick, active, and local, or where indeed publics have yet to be constituted." If we study issues of domination, marginalization, and social injustice, but do not orient our work toward alleviating them in real, material ways, our scholarship may benefit our careers at the expense of the very communities we research.

Second, a post-discipline of transgender studies must be open to a wider range of actors from a wider array of disciplinary homes, and it must actively foster new forms of relationality among those actors. Rather than building a disciplinary home for scholars working in the humanities, whether implicitly or explicitly, we must instead build a postdisciplinary community that welcomes and values the contributions of scholars from across biomedicine, the humanities, law, the social sciences, and STEM. This means we must recognize, appreciate, and incorporate into our own thinking and practice the theories and methods of scholars trained in disciplines outside our own to the extent they share our topics of focus and political investment in improving the material conditions in which transgender lives are lived. And that requires, as a starting point, that we read and cite across lines of disciplinary difference to a greater extent than we presently do. 

Finally, and relatedly, a post-discipline of transgender studies must have a more expansive and more robust institutional architecture. Waisbord (2019, 123--24) writes that the post-discipline of communication is "held together by an institutional architecture of professional organizations, academic units, and journals," rather than by any coherent canon of theories or set of standard methodologies. However, transgender studies is not so lucky as to have such alternative sources of unity outside of the journal *TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly*. While *TSQ*'s contribution to the field has been monumental, it has also been critiqued for its narrow focus on humanistic inquiry (see, e.g., Ashley 2020; Billard 2020; Cull 2020; Turner 2020). In some ways, these critiques are warranted, because the journal *has* formally announced itself as the "journal of record" for the field of transgender studies (Institute for LGBT Studies, n.d.). In other ways, these critiques are perhaps asking too much of *TSQ* as a journal focused on cultural studies. Regardless, *TSQ* was, until the launch of the *Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies*, the only venue dedicated to trans studies research not explicitly focused on health. These health journals---the *International Journal of Transgender Health*, published by Taylor & Francis, and *Transgender Health*, published by Mary Ann Liebert---are the only other journals that exclusively publish research on transgender topics, but they lack any substantive dialogue with the broader field of trans studies. 

Importantly, *TSQ* has always been firmly trans-led whereas the *International Journal of Transgender Health* is associated with the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and *Transgender Health* was founded by a scholar connected to, but not a member of the trans community. In this way, the *Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies* serves as a bridge between these journals that have built up the field at ostensibly opposite ends of a disciplinary spectrum.[^3] In so doing, we aim to make further space for meaningful and engaged research with trans communities, uplift and center scholarship from trans perspectives, and, importantly, expand transgender studies into the post-discipline that we believe it can become. Our goal is not to carve out an alternative space for empirical inquiry, which is already in many ways valued over and pitted against cultural analysis in the neoliberal university, nor is it to serve as an addendum to the field or parallel avenue for social scientists to publish work that is out of scope for these other journals. Rather, we envision applied transgender studies to be an elaboration upon the existing field of transgender studies that recognizes the painful history of biomedical inquiry and pathologization, as well as the recent interventions from within and outside of the sciences that center the self-determination, agency, and lived experiences of trans people. 

What is needed, then, is a greater degree of dialogue among the four journals currently publishing scholarship on transgender topics. The research published in each should meaningfully engage with the work published in the others, and there should be greater overlap in their editorial boards, their author lists, and their scholarly commitments. We may also need to launch additional journals with either more general foci or with a greater variety of specialized foci as the field expands. Additionally, we need to create new intellectual spaces in which to bring together scholars working across the various areas of study that would comprise a post-discipline of transgender studies, and to bring them together in collaborative, rather than combative, ways. The Center for Applied Transgender Studies was established to provide one such space, but it cannot be the only one. 

We also need more tenure stream jobs focused on transgender studies and we need programs in trans studies at universities (Adair, Awkward-Rich, and Marvin 2020), though they should be housed independently or crossdisciplinarily, rather than within the confines of queer theory and gender studies programs and departments (Keegan 2020a, 2020b). Finally, as Stryker (2020) has called for, we need a professional society (other than the World Professional Association of Transgender Health), and this society should be steadfast in its commitment to a postdisciplinary field. That society should also host regular conferences, where the kinds of crosscutting conversations a post-discipline requires can be had. These kinds of institutionalization would create opportunities to materially support the kind of applied trans studies scholarship for which we argue.

In short, we must tear down the walls being built, whether intentionally or inadvertently, in the efforts to make trans studies a humanistic discipline. Instead, we must build a robust institutional architecture that can house a flourishing post-discipline of transgender studies.

## Toward an applied transgender studies

For transgender studies to establish itself as a post-discipline in the manner laid out in the preceding section, it must necessarily orient itself toward an *applied transgender studies*. Of course, this does not mean that *all* trans studies must become *applied* trans studies. Certainly not. As Anna Lauren Hoffmann (2022) so clearly articulated in her opening remarks at the Applied Trans Technology Studies Symposium, applied trans studies

> is not some positivistic competitor to trans studies as it has emerged and unfolded in the humanities, but rather a complement---a space where further critical, technical, and social scientific methods can find recognition as we work to address the material and political exigencies of trans life.

What we mean to suggest, then, is that the broader postdisciplinary field of transgender studies must be held together by the same animating impulse that motivates applied trans studies, which is to mobilize the wealth of theoretical and methodological tools available to us to produce scholarship that aims to improve the material realities of transgender existence. In the words of Austin Johnson (2022a, 2022b), we must aspire to "do" trans studies in a way that "builds structural competency" within and for transgender movements for justice. We must find ways to take transgender research out of the tower and into the public, where we can intervene in the dismal state of affairs facing our communities.

This inaugural double issue of the *Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies* kicks off what we hope to be an enduring effort to foster and facilitate a post-discipline of transgender studies. The journal aims to serve as a venue for the kinds of work we have advocated for in this article. And the scholarship contained within the pages of this issue speaks to the breadth of transgender studies that exists within the academy beyond that which is published in *International Journal of Transgender Health*, *Transgender Health*, and *TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly*---scholarship that belongs in and is vital to our post-discipline. The areas of inquiry represented in this scholarship can and should be brought in conversation with each other and coordinated in their aims and mission.

The articles in this issue each represent the possibilities of applied transgender studies in different ways. Aniruddha Dutta's (2022) article, "Surviving COVID-19 in India: Transgender Activism in a Neoliberal--Developmentalist Assemblage," draws on critical theoretical frameworks and ethnographic observation in hijra and kothi communities in eastern India to analyze how trans activists navigate the ambivalences of contemporary governance to sustain their communities throughout crisis. In doing so, Dutta offers an incisive accounting of the institutional and policy landscapes that have created the conditions that make this activism necessary, which will be instructive for activists and policymakers alike.

Next, Cal Horton's (2022) article, "'Of Course, I'm Intimidated By Them. They Could Take My Human Rights Away': Trans Children's Experiences With UK Gender Clinics," offers an important, but underrepresented perspective on transgender health scholarship. Drawing on ten interviews with trans children and 30 interviews with the parents of trans children, Horton details the fraught experiences these children have in gender clinics in the United Kingdom and uses these illustrative data to make clear recommendations for healthcare workers in the UK serving trans youth populations.

Continuing a focus on transgender health, Gayle Brewer, Laura Hanson, and Noreen Caswell's (2022) article, "Body Image and Eating Behavior in Transgender Men and Women: The Importance of Stage of Gender Affirmation," draws on interviews with 22 transgender men and women in Britain to investigate the causes of disordered eating behaviors in trans populations. Importantly, they find that the roots of disordered eating among trans people differ from those among cisgender people, as trans people employ disordered eating behaviors to pursue a variety of transition-related goals. Highlighting the role that medical providers themselves play in encouraging disordered eating among trans people, Brewer and colleagues provide a clear vision of what must change to promote the health and well-being of trans communities across transition stages.

In the final health-focused study in this issue, Alischer Cottrill and colleagues' (2022) article, "'I Have to Decide How Attached to that Future I Feel': Fertility Intentions and Desires Among Transmasculine Young Adults," draws on 21 interviews with transmasculine people in the United States to better understand the barriers they face to acquiring fertility care. Identifying these various barriers, Cottrill and colleagues lay out the multilevel interventions needed to facilitate access to the full spectrum of fertility-related services transmasculine people need.

Next, Kai Jacobsen and Aaron Devor's (2022) article, "Moving from Gender Dysphoria to Gender Euphoria: Trans Experiences of Positive Gender-Related Emotions," sets aside the culturally dominant emphasis on gender dysphoria and the other negative emotional experiences of trans people to more deeply explore the concept of gender *euphoria*. Drawing on a small, but rich set of interviews with trans young adults in Canada, Jacobsen and Devor illustrate the limitations of purely medicalized models of trans identity and reveal the harms that can come from deficit- and distress-based narratives of transgender experience.

In the penultimate article, "Autistics Never Arrive: A Mixed Methods Textual Analysis of Transgender and Autistic Autobiography," Noah Adams (2022) analyzes 71 English-language autobiographical narratives from autistic-trans individuals since 2003. His analysis reveals the central significant of autistic-specific narratives of gender identity that differ from those dominant among non-autistic trans people, as well as the uncomfortable position autistic-trans people are placed in vis-à-vis the wider trans community. This work will be particularly illuminating for scholars working on issues of identity formation, community building, and group politics as we work to build a more inclusive and accessible transgender movement.

In the closing article of this inaugural issue, "Tipping Points and Shifting Expectations: The Promise of Applied Trans Studies for Building Structural Competency," Austin Johnson (2022b) reflects on his experiences of using research to build up grassroots networks of collective care in trans communities in the American South. Analyzing these experiences in the context of recent political attacks on the trans community in the US, Johnson argues that transformative change requires an increase in *structural competency* in our mainstream social institutions and makes the case for applied transgender studies as a path forward to that end.

Taken together, these articles offer an early glimpse into what applied transgender studies is and what a post-discipline of transgender studies can do. This work is international in its focus. It addresses important social problems through rigorous scholarship, mobilizing diverse theories and methods to better understand these problems and identify potential remedies. When this work addresses health contexts, it places trans voices at the center, building out visions of trans care based on trans people's needs, rather than cis providers' expectations. Moreover, it deeply considers the non-medical (i.e., social, cultural, and political) factors that shape transgender health in important ways. Finally, this work cuts across disciplinary boundaries to get to the very heart of matters and, in doing so, it aims to inspire change in the laws, policies, and practices that determine the life chances of transgender people.

The *Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies* will continue to publish such work as we work to build a robust post-discipline of transgender studies. It is our sincere hope that you join us in that endeavor in your own research and institutional service.

[^1]: The *Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies* is published by Northwestern University Libraries (NUL) on behalf of the Center for Applied Transgender Studies (CATS). We owe an immense debt of gratitude to NUL's Digital Publishing Librarian, Chris Diaz, for his tireless labor to secure the necessary agreements between CATS and NUL, to get the journal set up, and to manage the journal's ongoing production. We also owe thanks to Northwestern's Dean of Libraries, Sarah M. Pritchard, for believing the in value of the journal and putting the full resources of NUL behind it.

[^2]: While the differences between these various concepts are hard to nail down---particularly because of the inconsistent ways they are used by individual scholars and the tendency to slip between them as synonyms---Choi and Pak (2006, 351) offer the following distinctions:

    > Multidisciplinarity draws on knowledge from different disciplines but stays within their boundaries. Interdisciplinarity analyzes, synthesizes and harmonizes links between disciplines into a coordinated and coherent whole. Transdisciplinarity integrates the natural, social and health sciences in a humanities context, and transcends their traditional boundaries.

[^3]: The editorial board of the *Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies*---developed, as it was, with the aim of fostering a post-discipline of transgender studies---counts current and former editorial board members from the *International Journal of Transgender Health*, *Transgender Health*, and *TSQ* among its members.
