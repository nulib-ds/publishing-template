- abstract: In conversation with Emmett Harsin Drager and Andrea Long
    Chu's "After Trans Studies," this collaborative essay also turns to
    questions of field formation and the ethos of trans studies.
    Situating the growth of the field in the material conditions of
    precarity under which trans knowledge-workers work, the authors
    argue that trans studies can't be "over" because, in fact, it isn't
    yet here. Rather than viewing this as only a dismal proposition,
    however, they insist that the tenuousness of trans studies provides
    us with the opportunity to envision and enact more sustaining ways
    of being "in the field."

- abstract: This roundtable considers trans theory's status as a site of
    thinking racialization, empire, political economy, and materiality
    in the current historical, institutional, and political moment. We
    ask, what does it mean to think trans in a time of crisis?, and what
    is the place of critique in a crisis?, acknowledging that global
    crises are not insulated from trans, and trans is not insulated from
    the world. This roundtable looks to materialist formations to think
    trans now, including a new materialism premised on thinking about
    trans embodiment outside of trans as subject position, the
    materialism of objects and commodities, and a historical materialism
    shaped by queer of color critique.

- abstract: This article presents a mixed methods content analysis of
    autobiographies by transgender autistics (autistic-trans). It
    incorporates books, anthologies, poems, and prose, including
    self-published, grey, and professionally published texts up to June
    2020. Seventy-one English-language texts in 15 separate books were
    identified. The first was published in 2003 and the majority have
    been published since 2013. The most common themes explored
    individuals' experience of autism diagnosis, community, coming out
    (as trans), and gender, with many speaking of being nonbinary,
    genderless, or using autism-specific genders (e.g., autigender).
    Notably, these themes, which exemplify those that are important to
    autistic-trans writers, contrast markedly with the topics of most
    academic work on autistic-trans lives. These experiences were
    explored in the context of the double empathy problem, the looping
    effect, gender performance, and trans healthcare access. These
    findings can be used to inform future research on the
    transgender-autistic community.

- abstract: The essay thinks radically differently about the concepts of
    black and trans\*. Trans\* and black thus denote poetic,
    para-ontological forces that are only tangentially, and ultimately
    arbitrarily, related to bodies said to be black or transgender. That
    is to say, they are differently inflected names for an anoriginal
    lawlessness that marks an escape from confinement and a besidedness
    to ontology. Manifesting in the modern world differently as race and
    gender fugitivity, black and trans\*, though pointed at by bodies
    that identify as black or trans\*, precede and provide the
    foundational condition for those fugitive identificatory
    demarcations. The author seeks to demonstrate the ways in which
    trans\* is black and black is trans\*. In what ways, and to what
    extent, is there a "blackness" present within "trans\*-ness," and
    vice versa? What is the effect of these analytics? This essay hopes
    to address these questions but also leave them suspended in
    black/trans\* liminality.

- abstract: This conversation meditates on the ways in which Black
    Feminism and Trans Feminism relate to one another, how they speak to
    and supplement one another, and how they are in fact constitutive.
    Considering that Black feminism, historically, has attempted to
    interrogate the capaciousness of the very term "woman" and to
    gender, if you will, an androcentric "Blackness," one might say, as
    Che Gossett has said, that Black feminism is "always already trans."
    The present conversation, taking place via e-mail from October of
    2015 to October of 2017, is a dialogue conducted by Black feminist
    scholars that deeply engages prevailing notions of Blackness and
    transness, and radicalizes how these are understood with respect to
    feminism. In short, it is a conversation in Black, in trans, in
    feminism, and offers different conceptions of how Black and trans
    and feminism work with and through one another.

- abstract: "I argue for a new model of public scholarship in the field
    of communication---one that defines public-ness not in terms of
    publicity but in terms of the public good. Synthesizing work on
    public scholarship in communication and sociology with participatory
    action research frameworks, I narrate my experiences of fieldwork in
    the U.S. transgender rights movement. In doing so, I demonstrate the
    reciprocal benefits of fieldwork for both scholars and the publics
    served by social justice organizations. I further discuss the depths
    of public engagement permitted and achieved via fieldwork relative
    to publicity-centered scholarship. Finally, I address the ideal role
    of public engagement as scholars: contributing specialized skills
    and knowledge toward the mitigation of social problems. Ultimately,
    I argue, if a scholar publicly engages in issues of social justice
    without orienting their public work toward alleviating injustice,
    then they are actively sustaining the systems of oppression they
    benefit from researching."

- abstract: This roundtable began as the first panel of the
    International Communication Association dedicated exclusively to
    transgender studies. The articles of the panel investigated various
    domains of mediated representation, from television to newspapers to
    online pornography to Tumblr blogs. The differences in media,
    methods, and theoretical frameworks across the articles allowed for
    the panel to cover a broad swath of transgender representation in
    the current media environment. At the same time, their intersections
    allowed for conversation to move beyond theoretical understandings
    of media representation inherited from feminist and LGB studies to
    think about what transgender-specific modes of representation may
    be, how they differ from other modes of representation, and how the
    consequences of these transgender-specific modes may also,
    therefore, differ. After some time away to reflect, the panelists
    sat back down to answer important questions about how their work
    pushes both the theory and the practice of transgender media
    representation forward.

- abstract: Previous research suggests that transgender men and women
    are more likely to experience body dissatisfaction and disordered
    eating. Few studies have, however, investigated the manner in which
    body dissatisfaction and eating behavior are affected by the gender
    affirmation process. To address this issue, semi-structured
    interviews were conducted with transgender men and women (\*N\* =
    22) recruited from British support groups. Participants were aged
    19--71 years. Participant sexuality included heterosexual,
    homosexual, pansexual, and asexual orientations and all participants
    identified themselves as white. For both transgender men and women,
    analyses revealed a shift from a focus on psychological wellbeing in
    the early stages of gender affirmation to physical wellbeing in the
    later stages. While body dissatisfaction appeared to dissipate as
    gender affirmation progressed, a common theme across the gender
    affirmation process was that both transgender men and women engaged
    in risky behaviors related to transforming body shape and size.
    Findings highlight the need to consider the influence of gender
    affirmation when researching the interconnections between attitudes,
    behavior, and emotions relating to gender identity.

- abstract: "\\\"How can social science make itself relevant to the
    intractable problems facing humanity in the twenty-first century?
    The social sciences are under threat from two main sources. One is
    external, reflected in a global university crisis that imposes the
    marketization of higher education on the ancient practice of
    scholarship. The other, internal threat is social science's
    withdrawal from publicly-engaged teaching and research into the
    protective bunker of disciplinarity. In articulating a vision for
    the public role of social science in the twenty-first century, John
    Brewer argues that these threats also constitute an opportunity for
    a new public social science to emerge, confident in its public value
    and fully engaged with the future of humanity in its teaching,
    research and civic responsibilities, while also remaining committed
    to science. The argument is presented in the form of an interpretive
    essay: thought-provoking, forward-looking, and challenging to
    intellectual orthodoxy. It should be read and debated by all
    researchers and teachers in the social science disciplines who are
    concerned by the future of higher education and the relevance of
    their subjects to the future of humankind.\\\"--Bloomsbury

- abstract: Though many transmasculine individuals pursue pregnancy,
    childbirth, and parenthood in their lifetimes, research on the
    reproductive health needs of this population remains limited. This
    study aimed to explore the fertility intentions and desires of
    transmasculine young adults, as well as the multilevel factors that
    influence their pregnancy-related decisions. We conducted in-depth
    interviews with transmasculine young adults aged 18--29 (\*N\* = 21)
    in Boston, MA, USA between February and July of 2018. Interviews
    were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach
    involving inductive and deductive coding via a codebook applied by
    two independent coders. While many participants reported no lifetime
    desire for pregnancy, a sizable minority expressed some desire to
    become pregnant in the future. Fertility intentions were shaped by a
    range of anticipated barriers, including gender dysphoria,
    difficulty navigating gendered stereotypes about pregnancy,
    inadequate information about fertility and pregnancy for
    transmasculine individuals, and a lack of health providers with the
    training and experience to offer high-quality pregnancy-related care
    to transmasculine patients. Multilevel interventions that address
    cisnormative stigma and discrimination in reproductive health care
    settings, improve patient-provider communication, and increase
    provider fluency with transmasculine health needs are necessary to
    facilitate access to the full spectrum of fertility-related services
    among transmasculine young adults.

- abstract: This paper considers the future prospects for Critical
    Management Studies and by extension management studies more
    generally. To explore these, two frameworks from the wider social
    sciences are deployed. The anchorpoint for the discussion is Michael
    Burawoy's work distinguishing types of scholarship on the bases of
    (a) conceptions of knowledge produced by social scientists, and (b)
    different audiences for that knowledge. Critical Management Studies
    is founded on critique but its future will be determined by how it
    makes its way across Burawoy's other domains of professional, policy
    and public scholarship. To examine this, I draw on John Brewer's
    recent articulation of the 'new public social science'. Brewer's
    problem-driven, post-disciplinary approach conceives the public
    value of social science as its conservation of moral sentiments and
    sympathetic imagination towards each other as social beings, and its
    ethical concern about the humanitarian future of humankind. The new
    public social science is normative and partisan, transgressive,
    scientific, and impactful. I argue that this provides a potentially
    fruitful template to guide future management studies. This is a
    future in which Critical Management Studies -- as management
    studies' critical and emancipatory conscience -- has a central role
    to play.

- abstract: Transgender and gender non-conforming people, particularly
    communities from predominantly working class and Dalit
    (oppressed-caste) backgrounds such as kothis and hijras, were among
    those hit hardest during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The
    COVID-19 crisis was exacerbated by the policies of the Indian state,
    which demonstrate an unstable assemblage or conjuncture of
    neoliberal and developmentalist tendencies, in keeping with
    long-term systemic patterns in the region. The article situates
    Indian trans activism during the COVID-19 pandemic within the
    context of the neoliberal--developmentalist assemblage that
    characterizes governance in contemporary India and examines the
    possibilities and limitations of such activism. During the COVID-19
    crisis, trans communities and activists contest and negotiate with
    the state in variable ways, sometimes bolstering and suturing
    neoliberal and developmentalist modes of governance and sometimes
    challenging or undermining them, and even playing them against each
    other. This article traces these varied negotiations and analyzes
    how they not only enable the survival of trans people through the
    pandemic, but also demonstrate ways activists may push back against
    the state's simultaneous regulation and neglect of their
    communities.

- abstract: "We are in a time labeled the \"transgender tipping point,\" a
    period characterized by the scaling up of legal protections,
    visibility, rights, and politics centered on transgender people. The
    contemporary visual landscape is populated with the bodies of Black
    women. How does the language and discourse of the tipping point
    elide the presence of a saturation of Black bodies? In academia this
    elision has taken the shape of the expansion and
    institutionalization of transgender studies as a discipline. We are
    interested in what happens to the category of transgender as it
    becomes routed through the logics and power lines of
    institutionality and the metrics of administration. This special
    issue of TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly is the product and
    process of our attempt to think through how the institutionalization
    of transgender studies as a discipline functions as a scene of
    subjection for blackness---for Black people and places."

- abstract: With transgender rights front and center in American
    politics, media, and culture, the pervasive myth still exists that
    today's transgender children are a brand new generation--pioneers in
    a field of new obstacles and hurdles. Histories of the Transgender
    Child shatters this myth, uncovering a previously unknown
    twentieth-century history when transgender children not only existed
    but preexisted the term transgender and its predecessors, playing a
    central role in the medicalization of trans people, and all sex and
    gender. Beginning with the early 1900s when children with
    \"ambiguous\" sex first sought medical attention, to the 1930s when
    transgender people began to seek out doctors involved in altering
    children's sex, to the invention of the category gender, and finally
    the 1960s and '70s when, as the field institutionalized, transgender
    children began to take hormones, change their names, and even access
    gender confirmation, Julian Gill-Peterson reconstructs the
    medicalization and racialization of children's bodies. Throughout,
    they foreground the racial history of medicine that excludes black
    and trans of color children through the concept of gender's
    plasticity, placing race at the center of their analysis and at the
    center of transgender studies. Until now, little has been known
    about early transgender history and life and its relevance to
    children. Using a wealth of archival research from hospitals and
    clinics, including incredible personal letters from children to
    doctors, as well as scientific and medical literature, this book
    reaches back to the first half of the twentieth century--a time when
    the category transgender was not available but surely existed, in
    the lives of children and parents.

    multifaceted and multidirectional. Rather than merely identifying

- abstract: Gender clinics engaging with pre-pubertal trans children are
    divided between those that endorse a gender affirmative approach and
    those that do not. Little evidence is available on how trans
    children experience non-affirmative gender clinics in early
    childhood. This study aimed to understand pre-pubertal trans
    children's recent experiences in non-affirmative gender clinics in
    the UK. Data focused on a cohort of trans children who socially
    transitioned under age eleven. Data were drawn from semi-structured
    qualitative interviews with ten trans children and 30 UK-based
    parents of trans children, focusing on children's pre-pubertal
    engagement with UK gender clinics. Themes are presented on 1)
    inappropriate assessment of gender; 2) trans children under
    pressure; and 3) distress and trauma in UK gender clinics. The
    article presents evidence of continued pathologisation and
    problematisation of childhood gender diversity in UK children's
    gender clinics. It demonstrates the harms pf the status quo and the
    need for systemic reform, providing modern affirmative care for
    younger trans children.

- abstract: While trans identities are typically understood through the
    distress-based concept of \*gender dysphoria\*, some trans people
    use the term \*gender euphoria\* to describe their experiences.
    Broadly defined as positive gender-related emotions, the concept has
    become more common in trans communities in recent years but has
    received little academic attention. To fill this gap, we conducted
    qualitative interviews with five trans individuals. We found that
    gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from
    affirmation of one's gender identity or expression and can include a
    wide variety of emotions and experiences. Gender euphoria can range
    from feelings of intense joy accompanying the attainment of
    milestones in gender transition through to a more consistent sense
    of calmness and relief occurring later in transition. We
    contextualize these findings within the gender minority stress model
    to explore the link between gender euphoria, dysphoria, and health
    and well-being generally. Our findings emphasize the value of
    prioritizing euphoria, happiness, and safety in gender-affirming
    care.

- abstract: In 2021, the United States experienced the most active year
    on record for anti-trans legislation. In 2022, we are witnessing the
    renewal of this legislative harassment, with increased success on
    the part of anti-trans lawmakers. When these bills are passed into
    law and, importantly, even when they are resoundingly defeated or
    fail to reach an actual vote, the harmful rhetoric and ideology that
    is attached to them reverberates throughout trans communities
    resulting in social and psychological harm for transgender,
    nonbinary, and gender diverse people. The burden of addressing and
    offsetting this harm is often placed on the shoulders of other trans
    people who serve as grassroots leaders in their communities. This
    article argues that while this support is lifesaving for individual
    trans people, transformative change requires an increase in
    \*structural competency\* in our mainstream social institutions, and
    makes the case for applied trans studies as a pathway to that end.

    force trans studies against queer theory: Because queer theory is
    the institutional context through which trans studies is invited
    into the university, it is also the containing ideological
    architecture against which trans studies must articulate itself.
    Trans studies is therefore pressed \"against\" queer theory as a
    discursive surface in a manner that limits it from being able to
    exit this disciplinary scenario."

- abstract: This essay maps the epistemological terrain trans\* studies
    may face as it is widely incorporated into queer studies programs,
    often housed within women's studies departments. Over the past two
    decades, queer studies and women's studies have rapidly
    professionalized, producing new modes of disciplinary power that may
    seek to either include or cite trans\* studies, often without fully
    welcoming its specific material and political investments. Under
    such conditions, trans\* studies may find itself heard largely as a
    but---an epistemic blockage, a distraction from proper objects, a
    hindrance to customary methods---that must be disciplined.

    populations with whom they share a wide range of bodily and lived
    experience. By foregrounding transgender's instability as a research
    variable, the authors argue for more precise methodological
    orientations in trans research, particularly regarding gender and
    sexual orientation. Drawing on their own data with trans men whose
    sexual attractions have shifted during transition, they argue
    against unidimensional interpretations of this experience. Feminists
    and critical race scholars suggest that race and gender frequently
    function as \"proxies\": variables that reduce the complexities of
    biosocial bodily experience to more quantifiable forms of data. The
    authors argue that much of the research conducted with transgender
    persons suffers from similar reductions, narrowing the
    epistemological frameworks through which these populations are
    subsequently investigated and understood. By contrasting the
    National Transgender Discrimination Survey's focus on the measurable
    experience of discrimination with research that makes broader claims
    regarding \"the transgender population,\" the essay invites
    researchers to develop a set of best practices that resemble those
    of feminist science studies scholars."

    it mean for trans people to show up for one another, to care deeply
    for one another? How have failures of care shaped trans lives? What
    care practices have trans subjects and communities cultivated in the
    wake of widespread transphobia and systemic forms of trans

- abstract: "Invisible Lives is the first scholarly study of
    transgendered people---cross-dressers, drag queens and
    transsexuals---and their everyday lives. Through combined
    theoretical and empirical study, Viviane K. Namaste argues that
    transgendered people are not so much produced by medicine or
    psychiatry as they are erased, or made invisible, in a variety of
    institutional and cultural settings. Namaste begins her work by
    analyzing two theoretical perspectives on transgendered
    people---queer theory and the social sciences---displaying how
    neither of these has adequately addressed the issues most relevant
    to sex change: everything from employment to health care to identity
    papers. Namaste then examines some of the rhetorical and semiotic
    inscriptions of transgendered figures in culture, including studies
    of early punk and glam rock subcultures, to illustrate how the
    effacement of transgendered people is organized in different
    cultural sites. Invisible Lives concludes with new research on some
    of the day-to-day concerns of transgendered people, offering case
    studies in violence, health care, gender identity clinics, and the
    law."

- abstract: Some estimates place more than 500,000 trans people in the
    South, making the region home to over one-third of the US trans
    population. A region with more anti-trans policies and fewer
    protections for trans people than other areas of the country, the
    South has become a kind of test kitchen for conservative attempts to
    enact anti-trans legislation through state and local governments.
    These policies are aimed at restricting trans people's access to
    healthcare, education, recreation, accommodations, and public
    facilities like restrooms, bathing facilities, and emergency
    housing.This trend peaked last year, as lawmakers around the
    country, yet concentrated in the South, proposed more anti-trans
    legislation than in any other year on record. States across the
    region have also renewed their efforts at legislating so-called
    "religious exemptions,"religious exemptions, attempting to implement
    pathways for faith-based discrimination against trans people in
    state-funded service agencies and organizations. In some cases,
    legislators went so far as to introduce anticipatory restrictions
    that block and in some cases punish local officials who enact their
    own protections for trans people in their communities.In most cases
    during the 2021 legislative sessions, local organizers across the
    region blocked these proposals. Yet, we are already witnessing the
    renewal of this legislative harassment in 2022. Whether they become
    bills or not, these proposals contribute to a hostile social climate
    for trans people. Trans youth are especially vulnerable to this
    legislative harassment, and their experiences of identity related
    stress are more likely to contribute to increased anxiety,
    depression, and suicidality. In this presentation, Johnson makes the
    case for using community-based research to build structural
    competency among grassroots, non-profit, and public service
    organizations who are developing interventions to support trans
    youth in the South.Austin H Johnson, PhD is an Assistant Professor
    in the Department of Sociology at Kenyon College and director of the
    Southern Equality Research & Policy Center at the Campaign for
    Southern Equality.

- abstract: "preface For some time now feminists have struggled with the
    challenges that transgender subjectivity brings to sexuality and
    gender binaries, especially in the understanding of the category
    \\\"woman.\\\" There have been several compilations that have touched on
    the subject, such as Transgender History, the Transgender Studies
    Reader, and Transgender Rights, as well as special issues of a range
    of social science and interdisciplinary journals. Queer historian,
    writer, and filmmaker Susan Stryker has been on the forefront of
    such efforts, deftly linking participants in exchanges over common
    questions and issues as the editor for her transgender anthology and
    transgender special issues for the interdisciplinary journals---the
    GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies and Women's Studies
    Quarterly. In her introduction to the Transgender Studies Reader,
    Stryker draws our attention to the lack of contri butions from
    people of color and the urgent need for a \\\"transgender stud ies\\\"
    that more adequately and carefully engaged the \\\"complex interplay
    between race, ethnicity, and transgender phenomenon.\\\"1 Bobby Noble
    makes a similar point in the review essay, \\\"'My Own Set of Keys':
    Medita tions on Transgender, Scholarship, Belonging,\\\" with which we
    begin this special issue. While providing an overview of some of the
    field-defining books that have been published over the past decade,
    he comments also on some of the limitations of a predominantly white
    referent for transgender subjectivity as currently represented in
    critical theory. Noble also points to a burgeoning set of material
    that is beginning to emerge from scholars of color on this topic
    grounded in a queer of color critique. We see this special issue of
    Feminist Studies as in part responding to Striker's and Noble's
    calls and also as offering a series of interdisciplinary
    interventions that engage the varied intersections and mutual
    constitu tiveness of transgender and critical race theory. This Race
    and Trans gender Studies special issue, then, asks that we think not
    only about the 247 248 Preface impact of race on transgender theory
    but also challenges those of us who work within critical race theory
    to more fully consider how our studies of racialized communities
    would be different if we put transgender subjects at the center of
    our work, especially in how we define women of color. The issue
    opens up spaces for considering a variety of themes including racial
    and ethnic identification and cross-identification in gender perform
    ance, strategies of belonging and kinship, racial implications of
    media representations of transgender subjects, transgender politics
    of location, subjugated knowledges, and histories---to name a few.
    Following Noble's review essay is Emily Skidmore's prize-winning
    article, \\\"Constructing the 'Good Transsexual': Christine Jorgensen,
    Whiteness, and Heteronormativity in the Mid-Twentieth-Century
    Press.\\\" In this article, selected as the 2008 Feminist Studies
    awardee for the best article by a graduate student, Skidmore
    deconstructs the whiteness of familiar transgender icons through her
    reassessment of the twentieth-century's most famous U.S. transsexual
    representative. Jorgensen created a media splash when in 1952 she
    traveled to Denmark for sex reassignment surgery (SRS). The story of
    an ex-GI turned beauty queen set off a media frenzy that established
    Jorgensen as an iconographic figure in U.S. transgender history,
    helping to create what Skidmore calls \\\"the good transsexual\\\" in
    the mainstream imagination. Skidmore contrasts Jorgensen's initial
    public acclaim with that greeting the lesser-known Delisa Newton, an
    African American transwoman who was featured on the April 1966 cover
    of Sepia magazine and whose autobiography was the subject of a
    two-part series featured in the magazine. Jorgensen's early 1950s'
    story was seized on by a white mainstream media as symbolic of the
    triumph of science---in this case enabling the emergence of a
    normative white \\\"bombshell\\\" from the form of a male army file
    clerk. Jorgensen was later vilified by this same press for not being
    a \\\"real\\\" woman, as the \\\"limits\\\" of her initial SRS became known.
    A decade later, Newton's story appeared in the African American
    press and print popular culture magazines and mainstream tabloid
    newspapers. Although Newton's SRS was far more complete than
    Jorgensen's initial treatment, the \\\"real\\\" woman Newton represented
    was African American and thus not deemed\\..."

- abstract: Race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of
    classification in technical infrastructures-from the passport to
    social media. Facial analysis technologies are particularly
    pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new
    technical systems. What facial analysis technologies can do is
    determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. In
    this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race
    and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for
    facial analysis. We found that the majority of image databases
    rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities
    are defined. Further, when they are annotated with race and gender
    information, database authors rarely describe the process of
    annotation. Instead, classifications of race and gender are
    portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. We discuss
    the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature
    of race and gender. We posit that the lack of critical engagement
    with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. We
    conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the
    histories of classification inherently embedded into race and
    gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such
    classifications.

- abstract: This article argues that activist claims about the erasure
    of transgender people in public health settings and research studies
    obscure a profusion of trans- and gender-nonconforming identities,
    embodiments, and terminology in public health contexts. Using the
    concept of a "transgender matrix," this work explains how
    proliferating transgender imaginaries result in differing
    conceptualizations of sex, gender, sexuality, race, and culture that
    resonate with similarly variable public health research
    categorization practices. Demographic categories are double-edged
    swords in that they are necessary for the redirection of resources
    toward socially marginalized people; at the same time, they often
    constitute the conditions of containment of these same people.
    Drawing on de Certeau's concept of a tactic, this article proposes a
    mode of evasion through the mobilization of alternate classificatory
    schemas based on interrelational race- and class-based categorical
    imaginaries. This is exemplified by an ethnographically documented
    account of the Trans-health Information Project (TIP), a federally
    funded public health program. TIP created nonstandard safer-sex
    outreach packets that employed classificatory mobility in an ongoing
    process of adaptation and change, mutating in response to specific
    racial, ethnic, and class-based differences through the use of local
    vernaculars. This tactical maneuver temporarily circumnavigated
    administrative capture.

- abstract: The story of Christine Jorgensen, Americas first prominent
    transsexual, famously narrated trans embodiment in the postwar era.
    Her celebrity, however, has obscured other mid-century trans
    narratives-ones lived by African Americans such as Lucy Hicks
    Anderson and James McHarris. Their erasure from trans history masks
    the profound ways race has figured prominently in the construction
    and representation of transgender subjects. C. Riley Snorton
    identifies multiple intersections between blackness and transness
    from the mid-nineteenth century to present-day anti-black and
    anti-trans legislation and violence. Drawing on a deep and varied
    archive of materials-early sexological texts, fugitive slave
    narratives, Afro-modernist literature, sensationalist journalism,
    Hollywood films-Snorton attends to how slavery and the production of
    racialized gender provided the foundations for an understanding of
    gender as mutable. In tracing the twinned genealogies of blackness
    and transness, Snorton follows multiple trajectories, from the
    medical experiments conducted on enslaved black women by J. Marion
    Sims, the father of American gynecology,to the negation of blackness
    that makes transnormativity possible. Revealing instances of
    personal sovereignty among blacks living in the antebellum North
    that were mapped in terms of cross dressingand canonical black
    literary works that express black mens access to the female within,
    he concludes with a reading of the fate of Phillip DeVine, who was
    murdered alongside Brandon Teena in 1993, a fact omitted from the
    film Boys Dont Cry out of narrative convenience.

- abstract: "Welcome to TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly, which we
    intend to be the journal of record for the rapidly consolidating
    interdisciplinary field of transgender studies. Although the field
    is only now gaining a foothold in the academy, the term transgender
    has a long history that reflects multiple, sometimes overlapping,
    sometimes even contested meanings. For some, it marks various forms
    of gender crossing; for others, it signals ways of occupying genders
    that confound the gender binary. For some, it confers the
    recognition necessary for identity-based rights claims; for others,
    it is a tool to critically explore the distribution of inequality.
    The term transgender, then, carries its own antinomies: Does it help
    make or undermine gender identities and expressions? Is it a way of
    being gendered or a way of doing gender? Is it an identification or
    a method? A promise or a threat? Although we retain transgender in
    the full, formal title of this journal, we invite you to imagine the
    T in TSQ as standing in for whatever version of trans- best suits
    you --- and we imagine many of our readers, like us, will move back
    and forth among several of them. We call your attention as well to
    our use of the asterisk (symbol of the open-ended search) in the
    journal's logo, our hopefully not-too-obscure gesture toward the
    inherently unfinishable combinatorial work of the trans- prefix.
    Whatever your critical, political, or personal investment in
    particular trans- terminologies, we hope that you will find --- or
    make --- an intellectual home for yourself here.1"

    of its roots in various disciplinary traditions, it is built on
    fluid intellectual boundaries. Should we worry about this state of

    accepting and stimulating differences\"-- Provided by publisher.
