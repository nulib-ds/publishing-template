            is the Chair in Transgender Studies and Professor of Sociology at the University of Victoria. He is the founder and academic director of the Transgender Archives, as well as founder and host of the international, interdisciplinary Moving Trans History Forward conferences. While trans identities are typically understood through the distress-based concept of gender dysphoria, some trans people use the term gender euphoria to describe their experiences. Broadly defined as positive gender-related emotions, the concept has become more common in trans communities in recent years but has received little academic attention. To fill this gap, we conducted qualitative interviews with five trans individuals. We found that gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from affirmation of one’s gender identity or expression and can include a wide variety of emotions and experiences. Gender euphoria can range from feelings of intense joy accompanying the attainment of milestones in gender transition through to a more consistent sense of calmness and relief occurring later in transition. We contextualize these findings within the gender minority stress model to explore the link between gender euphoria, dysphoria, and health and well-being generally. Our findings emphasize the value of prioritizing euphoria, happiness, and safety in gender-affirming care.

    While trans identities are typically understood through the distress-based concept of *gender dysphoria*, some trans people use the term *gender euphoria* to describe their experiences. Broadly defined as positive gender-related emotions, the concept has become more common in trans communities in recent years but has received little academic attention. To fill this gap, we conducted qualitative interviews with five trans individuals. We found that gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from affirmation of one's gender identity or expression and can include a wide variety of emotions and experiences.

- abstract: The paper examines first-hand accounts of differently
    gendered emotional experience of the autism spectrum drawn from
    responses to online surveys, blogs and published autobiographies.
    Analysis of these materials reveals that atypical experiences and
    expressions of gender are considered relatively common among those
    on the spectrum. More literal minded than most, many describe
    meticulous attempts to seek out and solidify gender's troubling
    manifestations in their social worlds, only to find, of course, that
    no such thing as gender exists. However, this oddly absent presence
    continues to haunt autistic emotional lives; its uncanny leavings
    and doings persist, and most (neuro)typical others remain in its
    thrall, seeming to learn gender's nebulous rules as if
    telepathically. First-hand autistic accounts highlight the draining
    and relentless emotional labour that doing gender 'typically'
    requires, and many on the spectrum respond by explicitly rejecting
    or simply neglecting its confounding demands, identifying with
    neither side of the m/f divide in attempts to give up the ghost of
    gender.

- abstract: This article contributes to the burgeoning literatures on
    the sociology of diagnosis and transgender studies by examining the
    relationship between diagnostic processes and the legitimation of
    gender identity---the medicalization of transgender people. In order
    for trans-identified people to access medical and surgical services,
    they must submit to a complex mental health diagnostic process that
    relies on criteria set by the American Psychiatric Association and
    the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH). By
    focusing on provider experiences of using the Gender Identity
    Disorder (GID) diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of
    Mental Health Disorders, Fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR)
    to meet the requirements of WPATH's Standards of Care (SOC-6), we
    show that diagnostic processes can both support and inhibit a
    transpatient's abilities to access services. Participants reveal how
    deeply held cultural views pertaining to gender, mental health, and
    patient competency are entrenched in diagnostic categories. While
    the new DSM-5 has relabeled GID as Gender Dysphoria and the SOC-7
    has somewhat lessened the requirements for accessing hormone
    treatments, our data suggest that these changes will not be enough
    to alter the underlying structure of social control and power that
    diagnostic categories have over transpeople and their providers.

- abstract: Drawing from contemporary blog data, this article examines
    an emerging project termed "neuroqueer." Neuroqueer is a
    collaboration of activists, academics, and bloggers engaging in
    online community building. Neuroqueer requires those who engage in
    it to disidentify from both oppressive dominant and counterculture
    identities that perpetuate destructive medical model discourses of
    cure. It is a queer/crip response to discussions about gender,
    sexuality, and disability as pathology that works to deconstruct
    normative identity categories. Blog members employ neuroqueer
    practices to subversively combat exclusion through rejection of
    able-hetero assimilation and counteridentification in favor of
    disidentification. Of particular interest for this special issue are
    the ways in which neuroqueer perspectives build more fluid
    conceptualizations of both gender and intersectionality through
    conscious disidentification from neurotypical norms and medical
    notions of cure on which they are often unconsciously based.

- abstract: Autistic and non-autistic adults' agreement with scientific
    knowledge about autism, how they define autism, and their
    endorsement of stigmatizing conceptions of autism has not previously
    been examined. Using an online survey, we assessed autism knowledge
    and stigma among 636 adults with varied relationships to autism,
    including autistic people and nuclear family members. Autistic
    participants exhibited more scientifically based knowledge than
    others. They were more likely to describe autism experientially or
    as a neutral difference, and more often opposed the medical model.
    Autistic participants and family members reported lower stigma.
    Greater endorsement of the importance of normalizing autistic people
    was associated with heightened stigma. Findings suggest that
    autistic adults should be considered autism experts and involved as
    partners in autism research.

- abstract: Introduction There is a growing clinical recognition that a
    significant proportion of patients with gender dysphoria have
    concurrent autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Aim The purpose of this
    review is to systematically appraise the current literature
    regarding the co-occurrence of gender dysphoria and ASD. Methods A
    systematic literature search using Medline and PubMed, PsycINFO, and
    Embase was conducted from 1966 to July 2015. Main Outcome Measures
    Fifty-eight articles were generated from the search. Nineteen of
    these publications met the inclusion criteria. Results The
    literature investigating ASD in children and adolescents with gender
    dysphoria showed a higher prevalence rate of ASD compared with the
    general population. There is a limited amount of research in adults.
    Only one study showed that adults attending services for gender
    dysphoria had increased ASD scores. Another study showed a larger
    proportion of adults with atypical gender identity and ASD.
    Conclusion Although the research is limited, especially for adults,
    there is an increasing amount of evidence that suggests a
    co-occurrence between gender dysphoria and ASD. Further research is
    vital for educational and clinical purposes.

- abstract: Autism narratives are not just stories or histories,
    describing a given reality. They are creating the language in which
    to describe the experience of autism, and hence helping to forge the
    concepts in which to think autism. This paper focuses on a series of
    autobiographies that began with Grandin's Emergence. These are often
    said to show us autism from the 'inside'. The paper proposes that
    instead they are developing ways to describe experience for which
    there is little pre-existing language. Wittgenstein has many
    well-known aphorisms about how we understand other people directly,
    without inference. They condense what he had found in Wolfgang
    Köhler's Gestalt Psychology. These phenomena of direct understanding
    what other people are doing are, Köhler wrote, 'the common property
    and practice of mankind'. They are not the common property and
    practice of people with autism. Ordinary language is rich in age-old
    ways to describe what others are thinking, feeling and so forth.
    Köhler's phenomena are the bedrock on which such language rests.
    There is no such discourse for autism, because Köhler's phenomena
    are absent. But a new discourse is being made up right now, i.e.
    ways of talking for which the autobiographies serve as working
    prototypes.

- abstract: "Individuals who experience a gender identity that is
    discordant with biological sex are increasingly presenting to
    physicians for assistance in alleviating associated psychological
    distress. In contrast to prior efforts to identify and primarily
    address underlying psychiatric contributors to gender dysphoria,
    interventions that include uncritical social affirmation, use of
    gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to suppress normally timed
    puberty, and administration of cross-sex steroid hormones to induce
    desired secondary sex characteristics are now advocated by an
    emerging cohort of transgender medicine specialists. For patients
    with persistent gender dysphoria, surgery is offered to alter the
    appearance of breasts and genital organs. Efforts to address ethical
    concerns regarding this contentious treatment paradigm are dependent
    upon reliable evidence on immediate and long-term risks and
    benefits. Although strong recommendations have been made for
    invasive and potentially irreversible interventions, high-quality
    scientific data on the effects of this approach are generally
    lacking. Limitations of the existing transgender literature include
    general lack of randomized prospective trial design, small sample
    size, recruitment bias, short study duration, high subject dropout
    rates, and reliance on ?expert? opinion. Existing data reveal
    significant intervention-associated morbidity and raise serious
    concern that the primary goal of suicide prevention is not achieved.
    In addition to substantial moral questions, adherence to established
    principles of evidence-based medicine necessitates a high degree of
    caution in accepting gender-affirming medical interventions as a
    preferred treatment approach. Continued consideration and rigorous
    investigation of alternate approaches to alleviating suffering in
    people with gender dysphoria are warranted.Summary:This paper
    provides an overview of what is currently known about people who
    experience a gender identity that differs from their biological sex
    and the associated desire to engage the medical profession in
    alleviating associated discomfort and distress. The scientific
    evidence used to support current recommendations for affirming one?s
    preferred gender, halting normally timed puberty, administering
    cross-sex hormones, and surgically altering primary and secondary
    sexual traits are summarized and critically evaluated. Serious
    deficits in understanding the cause of this condition, the reasons
    for the marked increase in people presenting for medical care,
    together with immediate and long-term risks relative to benefit of
    medical intervention are exposed."

- abstract: "The prevalence of nontraditional gender identities in many
    autistic people raises provocative questions for feminist scholars.
    In particular, autistic writers often invite alternative
    understandings of sex/gender as a multiple, rhetorical phenomenon.
    Autobiographies, blogs, and Internet posts show how autistic
    individuals view gender as a copia, or tool for inventing multiple
    possibilities through available sex/gender discourses. Four
    particular discourses emerge through which autistic people
    understand gender: identification, neurodiversity, performance, and
    queer identity."

- abstract: The rhetorical figure of the incrementum, or scale, can help
    to account for how autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been
    gendered as male, especially in Simon Baron-Cohen's \"Extreme Male
    Brain\" theory. The incrementum occurs when female, male, and
    autistic brains are placed along a scale according to systemizing
    and empathizing abilities. This double hierarchy reinforces popular
    beliefs about sex and gender, drawing on the cultural resources of
    hi-tech culture, the service economy, and geekiness. In so doing,
    these theories overlook other important aspects of ASD, including
    alternative theories, the presence of autistic women and girls, and
    the needs and interests of autistic people themselves.

- abstract: Transgender (trans) people experience high rates of mental
    health issues including depression and suicidality. Improving access
    to transition-related medicine such as hormones and surgeries is
    suggested as an important mechanism to address these mental health
    issues. Yet clinicians experience challenges assessing and referring
    trans people for transition-related medicine. Standardized
    assessment protocols have been therefore recommended to optimize
    care. Although standardized protocols are purported to expand access
    to hormones and surgeries for trans people, it is unclear whether
    these tools achieve this goal. We therefore conducted an
    institutional ethnography to explicate how standardized readiness
    assessments coordinate access to hormones and surgeries in Canada.
    We analyzed key texts, talked with trans people, clinicians,
    clinician-educators, and administrators (total n = 22), and observed
    clinician-education workshops. In the context of determining
    transition readiness, standardized protocols direct clinicians to
    explore alternative diagnoses and assess the degree to which any
    complex mental health condition is "managed" prior to initiating
    hormones or surgeries. In response, we found that trans patients
    downplay or withhold mental health concerns from clinicians, or
    otherwise do additional work (e.g., take up unwanted psychiatric
    interventions) to convince providers they are "mentally ready" to
    transition. This phenomenon is paradoxical in that
    transition-related medicine is recommended to mitigate trans
    people's psychosocial distress, but when patients reveal symptoms of
    distress they encounter significant barriers to treatment. We
    conclude that the logic underpinning pre-transition "mental
    readiness" assessments discredits the claim that standardized
    protocols optimize access to hormones and surgeries.

- abstract: Obtaining deep-level insights into the thoughts, actions,
    and emotions of organizational leaders can pose significant
    challenges to organizational scholars. Fortunately, a promising but
    largely untapped resource to provide such insights
    exists---autobiographies. We begin by providing an overview of
    autobiographies as a data source, including their benefits and
    limitations. We then discuss where autobiographies could contribute
    to theory development in organizational research, highlighting the
    areas of strategic leadership and entrepreneurship, identity, and
    sensemaking. To provide direction on how to incorporate these texts
    into a research design, we provide several research ideas and
    guidelines about how autobiographies could be used in a triangulated
    research design. We illustrate their use in a recent study conducted
    among craft entrepreneurs to confirm existing findings and document
    a series of planned studies using autobiographies to explore new
    findings. Together, the study, although focusing on autobiographies,
    offers a broader framework to advance the use of narrative forms in
    organizational scholarship.

- abstract: "More than 35 years ago I developed the basic procedures of
    a qualitative content analysis which are still widely used in
    qualitative oriented social science text analysis. I want to give an
    overview of the reception and recent developments of this
    approach.Three topics are elaborated in this article: First the
    theoretical background of qualitative content analysis is summarized
    and compared to other approaches of social science text analysis.
    This includes a differentiation of quantitative content analysis. In
    quantitative content analysis the process of categorization is
    running automatically, following a fixed algorithm, whereas in
    qualitative content analysis the assignment of categories to text
    passages always remains an act of interpretation. But this process
    strictly follows rules of interpretation. Second, the reception of
    my conception of qualitative content analysis is retraced and some
    misunderstandings cleared up. Additionally, the approach of
    qualitative content analysis proposed by Margrit SCHREIER and Udo
    KUCKARTZ is compared to my concept. This is demonstrated with an
    example. Third, recent developments are reviewed and free available
    software especially developed for qualitative content analysis
    (QCAmap) is introduced."

- abstract: In recent decades there has been much debate over the
    ontological status of autism and other neurological 'disorders',
    diagnosed by behavioural indicators, and theorised primarily within
    the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychological paradigms.
    Such cognitive-behavioural discourses abstain from acknowledging the
    universal issue of relationality and interaction in the formation of
    a contested and constantly reconstructed social reality, produced
    through the agency of its 'actors'. The nature of these contested
    interactions will be explored in this current issues piece through
    the use of the term the 'double empathy problem', and how such a
    rendition produces a critique of autism being defined as a deficit
    in 'theory of mind', re-framing such issues as a question of
    reciprocity and mutuality. In keeping with other autistic
    self-advocates, this piece will refer to 'autistic people', and
    'those who identify as on the autism spectrum', rather than 'people
    with autism'.

- abstract: "The desire for transgender futures has grown exponentially
    in recent years, but many of these futures are traps, concealing a
    demand to assume normative and neoliberal priorities in exchange for
    citizenship and belonging. This article argues that some of these
    traps might be undone through autistic disruption. Dwelling with the
    life writing and memoir of individuals both autistic and trans, it
    suggests that, by choice or by circumstance, autistic-trans
    narratives defy the chrononormative mandate of the able-minded
    future. By claiming autism and gender nonconformity as mutually
    inclusive, foregrounding alternative sensorealities, and
    interrupting the incitement to get better, this article argues that
    cripping trans time through autistic disruption offers what Gossett,
    Stanley, and Burton call a \"trap door\": a route of escape from the
    normate trans future and a way for autistic life to insist on its
    own continuation and survivance."

- abstract: "Purpose: There is evolving evidence that children and
    adolescents with gender dysphoria have higher-than-expected rates of
    autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet clinical data on ASD among youth
    with gender dysphoria remain limited, particularly in North America.
    This report aims to fill this gap.Methods: We conducted a
    retrospective review of patient chart data from 39 consecutive youth
    ages 8 to 20 years (mean age 15.8 years, natal male: n = 22, natal
    female: n = 17) presenting for evaluation at a multidisciplinary
    gender clinic in a large U.S. pediatric hospital from 2007 to 2011
    to evaluate the prevalence of ASD in this patient
    population.Results: Overall, 23.1% of patients (9/39) presenting
    with gender dysphoria had possible, likely, or very likely Asperger
    syndrome as measured by the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale
    (ASDS).Conclusion: These findings are consistent with growing
    evidence supporting increased prevalence of ASD in gender dysphoric
    children. To guide provision of optimal clinical care and
    therapeutic intervention, routine assessment of ASD is recommended
    in youth presenting for gender dysphoria."

- abstract: "Evidence indicates an overrepresentation of youth with
    co-occurring autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and gender dysphoria
    (GD). The clinical assessment and treatment of adolescents with this
    co-occurrence is often complex, related to the developmental aspects
    of ASD. There are no guidelines for clinical care when ASD and GD
    co-occur; however, there are clinicians and researchers experienced
    in this co-occurrence. This study develops initial clinical
    consensus guidelines for the assessment and care of adolescents with
    co-occurring ASD and GD, from the best clinical practices of current
    experts in the field. Expert participants were identified through a
    comprehensive international search process and invited to
    participate in a two-stage Delphi procedure to form clinical
    consensus statements. The Delphi Method is a well-studied research
    methodology for obtaining consensus among experts to define
    appropriate clinical care. Of 30 potential experts identified, 22
    met criteria as expert in co-occurring ASD and GD youth and
    participated. Textual data divided into the following data nodes:
    guidelines for assessment; guidelines for treatment; six primary
    clinical/psychosocial challenges: social functioning, medical
    treatments and medical safety, risk of victimization/safety, school,
    and transition to adulthood issues (i.e., employment and romantic
    relationships). With a cutoff of 75% consensus for inclusion,
    identified experts produced a set of initial guidelines for clinical
    care. Primary themes include the importance of assessment for GD in
    ASD, and vice versa, as well as an extended diagnostic period, often
    with overlap/blurring of treatment and assessment."

- abstract: "Despite research exploring autism in gender-diverse
    adolescents, no studies have elicited these individuals'
    perspectives. In-depth interviews with 22 well-characterized
    autistic gender-diverse adolescents revealed critical themes,
    including: recollections of pre-pubertal gender nonconformity; vivid
    experiences of gender dysphoria; a fear of social gender expression
    due to perceived animosity toward transgender people; and specific
    challenges that result from the interplay of gender diversity and
    neurodiversity. During the \\~ 22 month study social gender
    affirmation increased in six participants and gender dysphoria
    attenuated in four participants. Given the ethical imperative to
    understand and prioritize the voiced perspectives and needs of
    autistic gender minority adolescents as well as the discovery of
    shared themes and experiences in this population, results should
    inform clinical research approaches and priorities."

- abstract: Philosophical arguments regarding academic freedom can
    sometimes appear removed from the real conflicts playing out in
    contemporary universities. This paper focusses on a set of issues at
    the front line of these conflicts, namely, questions regarding sex,
    gender and gender identity. We document the ways in which the work
    of academics has been affected by political activism around these
    questions and, drawing on our respective disciplinary expertise as a
    sociologist and a philosopher, elucidate the costs of curtailing
    discussion on fundamental demographic and conceptual categories. We
    discuss some philosophical work that addresses the conceptual
    distinction between academic freedom and free speech and explore how
    these notions are intertwined in significant ways in universities.
    Our discussion elucidates and emphasises the educational costs of
    curtailing academic freedom.

- abstract: Studies have shown an increase of symptoms of autism
    spectrum disorder (ASD) in gender dysphoria (GD). Various hypotheses
    try to explain this possible co-occurrence (e.g., a role of
    resistance to change, stereotyped behaviors or prenatal testosterone
    exposure). This study examined ASD symptoms with the Children's
    Social Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ) in 490 children with GD
    compared to 2507 typically developing (TD) and 196 children with
    ASD. CSBQ total scores of the GD sample were in between scores from
    the TD and ASD sample. The GD sample showed elevated levels of
    autistic symptomatology on all subdomains, not only on stereotyped
    and resistance to change. Further, no gender differences and
    interaction effects were found on the total CSBQ, making a sole role
    for prenatal testosterone unlikely.

- abstract: "The current literature shows growing evidence of a link
    between gender dysphoria (GD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
    This study reviews the available clinical and empirical data. A
    systematic search of the literature was conducted using the
    following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus;
    utilizing different combinations of the following search terms:
    autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger's disorder (AD),
    co-morbidity, gender dysphoria (GD), gender identity disorder (GID),
    transgenderism and transsexualism. In total, 25 articles and reports
    were selected and discussed. Information was grouped by found
    co-occurrence rates, underlying hypotheses and implications for
    diagnosis and treatment. GD and ASD were found to co-occur
    frequently -- sometimes characterized by atypical presentation of
    GD, which makes a correct diagnosis and determination of treatment
    options for GD difficult. Despite these challenges there are several
    case reports describing gender affirming treatment of co-occurring
    GD in adolescents and adults with ASD. Various underlying hypotheses
    for the link between GD and ASD were suggested, but almost all of
    them lack evidence."

- abstract: Prior research has shown an elevation in autism traits and
    diagnoses in individuals seen for gender related consultation and in
    participants self-identifying as transgender. To investigate this
    relationship between autism and gender identity from a new angle, we
    compared the self-reported autism traits and sensory differences
    between participants with autism who did or did not identify with
    their assigned sex (i.e. cisgender or trans and non-binary,
    respectively). We found broad elevation of most cognitive autism
    traits in the trans and non-binary group (those who identified with
    a gender other than their assigned gender), and lower visual and
    auditory hypersensitivity. We contrast these data to existing
    hypotheses and propose a role for autistic resistance to social
    conditioning.

- abstract: We assessed whether recent psychological literature on
    children reflects or contrasts with the zeitgeist of American
    Psychological Association's recent non-discrimination statement on
    'transgender' and 'gender variant' individuals. Article records (N =
    94) on childhood 'gender identity' and 'expression' published
    between 1999 and 2008 inclusive were evaluated for two kinds of
    cisgenderism, the ideology that invalidates or pathologises
    self-designated genders that contrast with external designations.
    Misgendering language contradicts children's own gender assignations
    and was less frequent than pathologising language which constructs
    children's own gender assignations and expression as disordered.
    Articles on children's gender identity/expression are increasingly
    impactful within psychology. Cisgenderism is neither increasing nor
    decreasing overall. Mental health professionals are more
    cisgenderist than other authors. Articles by members of an
    'invisible college' structured around the most prolific author in
    this area are more cisgenderist and impactful than other articles.
    We suggest how authors and editors can implement American
    Psychological Association policy and change scientific discourse
    about children's genders.

- abstract: The question of judicial protection of trans people has come
    to the fore in recent years, culminating in Bill C-16 which added
    gender identity and gender expression to the federal
    anti-discrimination and hate crime laws. In this article, the author
    contests the notion that anti-discrimination and hate crime laws are
    effective in mitigating anti-trans harassment, discrimination, and
    violence. Suggesting that the model of anti-trans acts which
    underlies anti-discrimination and hate crime laws is erroneous, the
    author argues that the law's impact on trans well-being will be
    modest and that a careful analysis of anti-trans attitudes enables
    us to identify a number of more effective governmental avenues
    toward trans emancipation.

    best seen not as a precondition to transition-related care but as a
    process that can operate through transitioning, the article
    concludes that the gender-affirmative approach to trans youth care
    best fosters youth's capacity for healthy exploration. Unbounded
    social transition and ready access to puberty blockers ought to be
    treated as the default option, and support should be offered to
    parents who may have difficulty accepting their youth.

- abstract: The term 'rapid-onset gender dysphoria' (ROGD) was coined in
    2016 to describe an alleged epidemic of youth coming out as trans
    'out of the blue' due to social contagion and mental illness. The
    term reflects a deliberate attempt to weaponise scientific-sounding
    language to dismiss mounting empirical evidence of the benefits of
    transition. This article offers an introduction to the theory of
    ROGD and its history, presents a detailed critique of the empirical
    and theoretical claims associated with the theory, and highlights
    structural concerns with the ROGD discourse. The article argues that
    claims associated with ROGD, including assertions of declining
    mental health and degrading familial relationships following coming
    out, are best explained by the leading ROGD study's recruitment of
    parents from transantagonistic websites against a background of
    growing visibility and social acceptance of trans people. ROGD
    theory is best understood as an attempt to circumvent existing
    research demonstrating the importance of gender affirmation, relying
    on scientific-sounding language to achieve respectability.

- abstract: Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely
    acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within
    psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and
    theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We
    outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other
    qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and
    in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions.
    We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic
    analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and
    consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis.
    Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic
    analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful
    and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond
    psychology.

- abstract: Gender Identity Disorder of Childhood (GIDC)---a psychiatric
    diagnosis given to gendervariant children---has been controversial
    since its creation. Critics inside and outside of the mental health
    professions have called for the removal or revision of GIDC, arguing
    that it has served to pathologize homosexuality, to enforce
    normative notions of masculinity and femininity, and to recast a
    social problem as individual pathology. Drawing on published
    clinical and research papers, archival materials, and interviews
    with clinicians, researchers, and advocates, this article analyzes
    early studies of gendervariant boys from the 1960s and 1970s and
    describes the process through which the GIDC diagnosis was created.
    The article examines some of the limitations of current debates over
    GIDC and points out new trends that hold the most promise for
    providing support to gender-variant children.

- abstract: "Background: Transgender and non-binary children and young
    people and their parents in England, UK are poorly served across a
    range of healthcare settings. Whilst UK equalities legislation and
    international guidance on transgender healthcare pathways protects
    this group from discrimination and mandates an affirmative approach,
    services in England are not keeping pace.Aims: This study aims to
    draw on the experiences of transgender and non-binary children,
    young people and their parents in a support group in England in
    order to investigate their experiences of healthcare provision, and
    to develop some ideas for improvement.Method: Data was collected
    with participants in a family support group which offers a parent
    helpline service, social groups for children and parents, and
    training for schools and other organizations. 65 parents and
    children from 27 families from the family support group attended
    participatory workshops where they were given a range of briefs:
    \"health,\" \"family,\" \"friends,\" and \"education.\" Their participation
    involved being asked to define their own interview questions and
    collect data by interviewing each other. Their interview notes
    constituted the raw data. Data was coded inductively by the author
    with respondent checking as a second stage.Results: Results
    constitute the views of a small group of people, so cannot be
    generalized. However, they do illustrate some of the issues which
    may arise. Participants' experiences elicited five key themes:
    professionals' perceived lack of clinical and therapeutic knowledge;
    mental distress caused by excessive waiting lists; professionals'
    stereotyped gender assumptions; direct discrimination within
    healthcare settings; and a lack of attention to parent and child
    voice, especially in terms of school-based experiences and where a
    patient had a diagnosis of autism."

- abstract: Background Trans and non-binary children and young people in
    England, UK struggle to gain access to affirming clinical care,
    despite the international research evidence pointing toward this
    best practice approach. Concurrently, they are subject to constant
    discussion in the UK national media and politics, where many
    negative assumptions are made about their needs, experiences and
    clinical provision. Their journey to seek appropriate care has not
    yet been documented.Aims We trace the experiences of trans and
    non-binary children and youth and their families in their decision
    to seek, searches for and experiences with affirmative and
    non-affirmative clinical input for help with their gender.Method 27
    dyadic, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with trans and
    non-binary children and young people and their parents from 13
    families.Results The process of seeking support via National Health
    Service clinical routes in England, UK is beset with lengthy waiting
    lists, issues with geographical inaccessibility, a lack of relevant
    clinical knowledge, and a failure to recognize the value of family
    expertise. Family doctors provide contraceptive hormones in lieu of
    proper access to puberty blocking or gender affirming hormones, and
    most families resort to private care they can ill afford.Discussion
    Training in gender identity and gender dysphoria is recommended for
    both family doctors, and children's mental health services. Gender
    identity development services could be decentralized, with local
    hubs offering more accessible support.

- abstract: "In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
    Manual of Mental Disorders, the American Psychiatric Association has
    changed the diagnosis of gender identity disorder to gender
    dysphoria (GD). In this critical narrative review we ask: What is
    gender dysphoria? We report on some of the inconsistencies in the
    articles that foreground distress while obfuscating the fact that
    not all trans and intersex people suffer stress or impaired
    functioning, and the inappropriate referencing to intersex people in
    the diagnostic criterion, claims about the GD diagnosis contributing
    to the depathologization of and reducing stigma surrounding trans
    people, the conceptualizations of \"gender dysphoric\" research
    subjects, and finally we question the etiological approaches using
    GD as a conceptual framework. We further suggest that there are a
    number of methodological issues that need to be resolved to be able
    to claim that the GD diagnosis can be validated. To shed light on
    these paradoxes and methodological issues in the DSM-5, we report on
    the content validity of GD by reviewing research articles
    postdiagnostic inception. These findings will contribute to the
    debate about the validity of GD as a diagnosis for the 21st century
    for those people who need to live a different gender to that
    assigned at birth."

- abstract: Although increasing numbers of children have socially
    transitioned to live in line with their gender identities, little is
    known about factors associated with their wellbeing. This study
    examines the associations between parent-reported family, peer, and
    school support for a youth's gender identity, as well as an
    objective measure of state-level support, with parent-reported
    internalizing symptoms in 265 transgender youth (67.2% transgender
    girls, 32.8% transgender boys), ages 3--15 years (M = 9.41,
    SD = 2.62). Parents who reported higher levels of family, peer, and
    school support for their child's gender identity also reported fewer
    internalizing symptoms; the objective measure of state-level support
    was not related to internalizing symptoms. Additionally, peer and
    school support buffered against the association between
    gender-related victimization and internalizing symptoms, as reported
    by parents. This work demonstrates that even among transgender youth
    with families who supported their transitions, parents see better
    well-being in their children when they also see more support for the
    child's gender identity from family, peers, and schools.

- abstract: True gender self child therapy is based on the premise of
    gender as a web that weaves together nature, nurture, and culture
    and allows for a myriad of healthy gender outcomes. This article
    presents concepts of true gender self, false gender self, and gender
    creativity as they operationalize in clinical work with children who
    need therapeutic supports to establish an authentic gender self
    while developing strategies for negotiating an environment resistant
    to that self. Categories of gender nonconforming children are
    outlined and excerpts of a treatment of a young transgender child
    are presented to illustrate true gender self child therapy.

- abstract: "The treatment of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD)
    prepubertal children has expanded both in scope and in the number of
    families seeking services over the past decade. This chapter reviews
    the extant standards of care and clinical guidelines for these
    children, synthesizing the WPATH, American Psychological
    Association, and Australian Standards of Care, while illustrating
    the ascendant approach for supporting these children: the gender
    affirmative model. The model is contrasted to earlier developed
    models of care, the \"living in your own skin\" model and the
    \"watchful waiting\" model. To illustrate the clinical approach of the
    gender affirmative model in contrast to the other two models, a
    hypothetical case of a young gender-exploring child is presented,
    with an analysis of how each of the three models might approach the
    child and family seeking care."

- abstract: An increasing number of transgender children---those who
    express a gender identity that is "opposite" their natal sex---are
    socially transitioning, or presenting as their gender identity in
    everyday life. This study asks whether these children differ from
    gender-typical peers on basic gender development tasks. Three- to
    5-year-old socially transitioned transgender children (n = 36) did
    not differ from controls matched on age and expressed gender (n =
    36), or siblings of transgender and gender nonconforming children (n
    = 24) on gender preference, behavior, and belief measures. However,
    transgender children were less likely than both control groups to
    believe that their gender at birth matches their current gender,
    whereas both transgender children and siblings were less likely than
    controls to believe that other people's gender is stable.

- abstract: "Background: Pediatric gender clinics have a long history of
    analyzing and scrutinizing parents of trans children. At present,
    gender services in countries like the UK continue to hold clinical
    sessions with parents of pre-adolescent transgender children,
    sometimes extending over many years. Clinician viewpoints dominate
    the limited existing literature, with little analysis of the
    perspectives of parents of trans children.Aims: The study aimed to
    understand the experiences that parents of socially transitioned
    pre-adolescent trans children have had in UK gender clinics.Methods:
    Data were drawn from semi-structured qualitative interviews with 30
    UK-based parents of socially transitioned trans children -- children
    who socially transitioned, for example, changed pronoun, under the
    age of eleven. This article analyzed a subset of a wider dataset,
    focusing on data from 23 parents relating to parental engagement
    with UK NHS gender clinics before their child reached
    adolescence.Results: Themes emerging from the dataset included
    parents feeling under a microscope, and parents finding gender
    clinic sessions judgemental, intrusive and inappropriate.
    Interviewees reported clinician discouragement of listening to and
    validating their children, as well as a lack of emotional
    support.Discussion: The article presents evidence of continued
    pathologisation and problematisation of childhood gender diversity
    in parental engagements with UK children's gender clinics. It
    concludes by contrasting current UK practice as described in
    parental accounts with gender affirmative approaches to supporting
    parents of trans children."

    increased risk for adverse mental health outcomes, but better family
    functioning may be protective. This study describes TGN youth's
    mental health and associations with family functioning in a
    community-based sample. Participants were from 33 families (96
    family members) and included 33 TGN youth, ages 13 to 17 years; 48
    cisgender (non-transgender) caregivers; and 15 cisgender siblings.
    Participants completed a survey with measures of family functioning
    (family communication, family satisfaction) and mental health of TGN
    youth (suicidality, self-harm, depression, anxiety, self-esteem,
    resilience). TGN youth reported a high risk of mental health
    concerns: suicidality (15% to 30%), self-harm (49%), clinically
    significant depressive symptoms (61%); and moderate self-esteem (M =
    27.55, SD = 7.15) and resiliency (M = 3.67, SD = 0.53). In adjusted
    models, better family functioning from the TGN youth's perspective
    was associated with better mental health outcomes among TGN youth (β
    ranged from −0.40 to −0.65 for self-harm, depressive symptoms, and
    anxious symptoms, and 0.58 to 0.70 for self-esteem and resiliency).
    Findings from this study highlight the importance of considering TGN
    youth's perspectives on the family to inform interventions to
    improve family functioning in families with TGN youth."

- abstract: "Purpose: We examined associations between family rejection
    and risk of suicide attempts and substance misuse among a national
    sample of transgender and gender nonconforming adults.Methods: Data
    were drawn from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey
    (N = 6456). This secondary analysis was restricted to 3458
    individuals who self-identified as transgender or gender
    nonconforming and provided complete data on study variables. We used
    multivariable logistic regression to examine health risks by level
    of reported family rejection (low/moderate/high), controlling for
    relevant sociodemographic characteristics.Results: Overall, 42.3% of
    the sample reported a suicide attempt and 26.3% reported misusing
    drugs or alcohol to cope with transgender-related discrimination.
    After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex assigned at birth,
    binary gender identity, income, education, and employment status,
    family rejection was associated with increased odds of both
    behaviors. Odds increased significantly with increasing levels of
    family rejection.Conclusions: Family rejection related to gender
    identity is an understudied interpersonal stressor that may
    negatively affect health outcomes for transgender and gender
    nonconforming individuals. A better understanding of the role of
    close relationships in both risk and resilience for transgender
    individuals is critical in the development of effective public
    health interventions for this community."

- abstract: The present study represents findings from interviews with
    five mothers, each of whom had a transgender child. All of the
    transgender children were natal/biological males between the ages of
    8 and 11 years old and had socially transitioned to living as girls.
    Ehrensaft's (2012) notion of the "true gender self" was integrated
    with an ecological perspective to examine multiple interacting
    contexts, including family, neighborhood, and school, in which the
    participants lived. An overarching theme of "transformation" (or
    lack thereof) was used to organize the findings in relation to the
    transgender children, their families, and their communities. Changes
    in relation to the children's demeanor and well-being before and
    after their social transitions (e.g., from shy and depressed to
    happy and well-adjusted), the parents' and other family members'
    feelings and reactions to the children's gender identities and
    expressions over time (e.g., health care professionals and school
    staff learning along with and from the families), and the responses
    of others in the community (e.g., lack of knowledgeable health care
    professionals and school personnel) are discussed. Findings have
    implications for practice and future research.

- abstract: "Research Findings: Under the United Nations Convention on
    the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), children have the right to express
    their views on all matters affecting them and to have those views
    given due weight. This right applies in the context of research;
    however, examples of young children being engaged as co-researchers
    remain rare. Practice or Policy: This article examines the
    implications of adopting an explicit UNCRC-informed approach to
    engaging children as co-researchers. It draws on a research project
    that sought to ascertain young children's views on after-school
    programs and that involved a university-based research team working
    along with 2 groups of co-researchers; each composed of 4 children
    aged 4 to 5. The article discusses the contribution made by children
    to the development of the research questions and choice of methods
    and their involvement in the interpretation of the data and
    dissemination of the findings. It suggests that, although there are
    limits to what young children can and will want to do in the context
    of adult-led research studies, an explicit UNCRC-informed approach
    requires the adoption of supportive strategies that can assist
    children to engage in a meaningful way, with consequent benefits for
    the research findings and outputs."

- abstract: Purpose  Standards for reporting exist for many types of
    quantitative research, but currently none exist for the broad
    spectrum of qualitative research. The purpose of the present study
    was to formulate and define standards for reporting qualitative
    research while preserving the requisite flexibility to accommodate
    various paradigms, approaches, and methods. Method  The authors
    identified guidelines, reporting standards, and critical appraisal
    criteria for qualitative research by searching PubMed, Web of
    Science, and Google through July 2013; reviewing the reference lists
    of retrieved sources; and contacting experts. Specifically, two
    authors reviewed a sample of sources to generate an initial set of
    items that were potentially important in reporting qualitative
    research. Through an iterative process of reviewing sources,
    modifying the set of items, and coding all sources for items, the
    authors prepared a near-final list of items and descriptions and
    sent this list to five external reviewers for feedback. The final
    items and descriptions included in the reporting standards reflect
    this feedback. Results  The Standards for Reporting Qualitative
    Research (SRQR) consists of 21 items. The authors define and explain
    key elements of each item and provide examples from recently
    published articles to illustrate ways in which the standards can be
    met. Conclusions  The SRQR aims to improve the transparency of all
    aspects of qualitative research by providing clear standards for
    reporting qualitative research. These standards will assist authors
    during manuscript preparation, editors and reviewers in evaluating a
    manuscript for potential publication, and readers when critically
    appraising, applying, and synthesizing study findings.

- abstract: Internationally and within New Zealand there has been a
    substantial increase in the demand for gender affirming healthcare
    over the past decade. The Youth'12 secondary school survey,
    estimated that approximately 1.2% of adolescents in New Zealand
    identify as transgender.¹ It is likely that this level of referrals
    to health services will continue in the foreseeable future. This
    guideline has been developed following the recognition that New
    Zealand's previous good practice guide, Gender Reassignment Health
    Services for Trans People within New Zealand,² which was based
    heavily on the World Professional Association of Transgender Health,
    Standards of Care, version 6 (WPATH SOC v6),³ requires updating to
    be in step with current practice and international guidelines.
    Transgender healthcare is a rapidly evolving area of medicine. WPATH
    is the international body responsible for producing standards of
    care. WPATH SOC v7,⁴ was published soon after New Zealand's good
    practice guide and version 8 is currently in development. This
    guideline is not intended to replace the WPATH SOC but to present
    additional guidance for the provision of gender affirming healthcare
    in Aotearoa, New Zealand. We hope that this guide will be used to
    support the development of health services providing gender
    affirming healthcare around the country and provide guidance to
    District Health Boards (DHBs). We use Sir Mason Durie's health
    framework to inform the kaupapa or approach of these guidelines.
    WPATH SOC v7 encourages culturally appropriate approaches which are
    contextually based.⁴ Durie's model for health promotion development,
    Te Pae Māhutonga (the Southern Cross), has two guiding principles
    which correspond to the pointer stars of the constellation, Te Mana
    Whakahaere and Ngā Manukura.⁵

- abstract: Transgender children who have socially transitioned, that
    is, who identify as the gender "opposite" their natal sex and are
    supported to live openly as that gender, are increasingly visible in
    society, yet we know nothing about their mental health. Previous
    work with children with gender identity disorder (GID; now termed
    gender dysphoria) has found remarkably high rates of anxiety and
    depression in these children. Here we examine, for the first time,
    mental health in a sample of socially transitioned transgender
    children.A community-based national sample of transgender,
    prepubescent children (n = 73, aged 3--12 years), along with control
    groups of nontransgender children in the same age range (n = 73 age-
    and gender-matched community controls; n = 49 sibling of transgender
    participants), were recruited as part of the TransYouth Project.
    Parents completed anxiety and depression measures.Transgender
    children showed no elevations in depression and slightly elevated
    anxiety relative to population averages. They did not differ from
    the control groups on depression symptoms and had only marginally
    higher anxiety symptoms.Socially transitioned transgender children
    who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally
    normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in
    anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within
    this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of
    children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have
    notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously
    reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.

- abstract: "A visible and growing cohort of transgender children in
    North America live according to their expressed gender rather than
    their natal sex, yet scientific research has largely ignored this
    population. In the current study, we adopted methodological advances
    from social-cognition research to investigate whether 5- to
    12-year-old prepubescent transgender children (N = 32), who were
    presenting themselves according to their gender identity in everyday
    life, showed patterns of gender cognition more consistent with their
    expressed gender or their natal sex, or instead appeared to be
    confused about their gender identity. Using implicit and explicit
    measures, we found that transgender children showed a clear pattern:
    They viewed themselves in terms of their expressed gender and showed
    preferences for their expressed gender, with response patterns
    mirroring those of two cisgender (nontransgender) control groups.
    These results provide evidence that, early in development,
    transgender youth are statistically indistinguishable from cisgender
    children of the same gender identity."

- abstract: This article proposes that survival may be considered a
    research method for social researchers, especially if they are
    undertaking fieldwork within marginalised communities of which they
    are a part. Drawing on an autoethnographic account of conducting
    research while trans, it shows how marginalised researchers may
    encounter both challenges common within the neoliberal university,
    and troubles specific to the researcher's social identity, touching
    on experiences of casualisation, distressing fieldwork, trauma, and
    suicide. The article concludes that marginalised researchers should
    not be held individually responsible for their own survival; rather,
    they require the active support of research communities and
    institutional frameworks.

- abstract: Chosen name use among transgender youth (youth whose gender
    identities are different from their sex assigned at birth) can be
    part of the complex process of aligning gender presentation with
    gender identity and can promote mental health. However, little is
    known about the factors that predict whether or not transgender
    youth have a chosen name and outcomes of chosen name use, especially
    in specific social contexts. We examined, among a sample of 129
    transgender youth from three cities in the United States,
    differences in sociodemographic characteristics and mental health
    outcomes between transgender youth with and without a chosen name
    and, among those with a chosen name, predictors and mental health
    benefits of being able to use a chosen name at home, school, and
    work. There were few differences between transgender youth with and
    without a chosen name. Among transgender youth with a chosen name,
    disclosure of gender identity to supportive family and teachers
    predicted chosen name use at home and school, respectively. Chosen
    name use was associated with large reductions in negative health
    outcomes and relatively smaller improvements in positive mental
    health outcomes. Our results show that chosen name use is part of
    the gender affirmation process for some, but not all, transgender
    youth and is associated with better mental health among transgender
    youth who adopt a chosen name.

- abstract: "Background : The literature on trans youth has been
    dominated by etiological studies interested in trans experience as a
    medical phenomenon. An emerging body of literature has begun to
    document that trans youth are a diverse, vulnerable, yet resilient
    population, and to investigate the role of various sites of support
    such as the family, peer groups, institutions, and community spaces
    in contributing to or impeding trans youth's well-being. Method:
    This article presents the results of Stage One of interviews (n =
    24) conducted for a Community-Based Participatory Action Research
    (CBPAR) qualitative research project based in Quebec. It studies the
    factors that enhance trans youth's well-being as well as the factors
    of oppression that negatively affect it. This paper offers a brief
    overview of the anti-oppressive methodology used for this project,
    emphasizing how CBPAR was combined with Grounded Theory (GT) methods
    to encourage the direct involvement of communities and the
    translation of knowledge into action. Results: We present
    preliminary categories emerging through the ongoing axial coding
    process. These categories address trans youth's experiences in and
    perceptions of various \"sites\": 1) healthcare services both for
    gender-related and general care, 2) other institutional spaces, 3)
    the family and other social circles, and 4) community spaces.
    Conclusion: While much of this study's results support existing
    evidence on trans youth's experiences, they also provide a more
    nuanced portrayal of the complex ways in which recognition, as well
    as non-, mis-, or mal-recognition, influence trans youth's
    well-being at different sites. We also argue that recognition itself
    must be considered through the lens of intersectionality."

- abstract: Trans and non-binary youth (TNBY) face high levels of
    interpersonal and social adversity as well as disproportionate rates
    of mental health issues such as depression, self-harm and suicidal
    ideation. Among protective factors, context plays a key role. In
    addition to parental support, access to gender-affirming medical
    care begins to emerge as crucial for young people needed them. This
    paper compares, through thematic analysis, the experiences of TNBY
    with regard to access and experiences to care in Canada,
    Switzerland, England, and Australia. It identifies similarities and
    differences in barriers to access to care, as well as impacts of
    gender affirming care on young people and their well-being. The
    article concludes with a discussion on the importance of prompt and
    easier access to gender-affirming medical care, of training of
    professionals, and a hypothesis about the role of context in TNBY
    well-being.

- abstract: "Background: Canadian specialty clinics offering
    gender-affirming care to trans and gender diverse children and youth
    have observed a significant increase in referrals in recent years,
    but there is a lack of information about the experiences of young
    people receiving care. Furthermore, treatment protocols governing
    access to gender-affirming medical interventions remain a topic of
    debate.Aims: This qualitative research aims to develop a deeper
    understanding of experiences of trans youth seeking and receiving
    gender-affirming care at Canadian specialty clinics, including their
    goals in accessing care, feelings about care and medical
    interventions they have undergone, and whether they have any regrets
    about these interventions.Methods: The study uses an adapted
    Grounded Theory methodology from social determinants of health
    perspective. Thirty-five trans and gender diverse young people aged
    9 to 17 years were recruited to participate in semi-structured
    interviews through the specialty clinics where they had received or
    were waiting for gender-affirming medical interventions such as
    puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery.Results: Young people
    felt positively overall about the care they had received and the
    medical interventions they had undergone, with many recounting an
    improvement in their well-being since starting care. Most commonly
    shared frustrations concerned delays in accessing interventions due
    to clinic waiting lists or treatment protocols. Some youth described
    unwanted medication side-effects and others said they had questioned
    their transition trajectory at certain moments in the past, but none
    regretted their choice to undergo the interventions.Discussion: The
    results suggest that trans youth and gender diverse children are
    benefiting from medical gender-affirming care they receive at
    specialty clinics, providing valuable insight into their
    decision-making processes in seeking care and specific
    interventions. Providers might consider adjusting aspects of
    treatment protocols (such as age restrictions, puberty stage, or
    mental health assessments) or applying them on a more flexible,
    case-by-case basis to reduce barriers to access."

- abstract: As a traditionally underserved population that faces
    numerous health disparities, youth who identify as transgender and
    gender diverse (TGD) and their families are increasingly presenting
    to pediatric providers for education, care, and referrals. The need
    for more formal training, standardized treatment, and research on
    safety and medical outcomes often leaves providers feeling ill
    equipped to support and care for patients that identify as TGD and
    families. In this policy statement, we review relevant concepts and
    challenges and provide suggestions for pediatric providers that are
    focused on promoting the health and positive development of youth
    that identify as TGD while eliminating discrimination and stigma.

- abstract: Past studies that compare cisgender to transgender (or
    trans) and gender diverse people have found a higher prevalence of
    mental health problems among the latter groups. This article uses
    Testa's gender minority stress framework, which is an expansion of
    minority stress theory, to assess minority stressors that are
    specific to the experiences of trans and gender diverse people. The
    concept of cisnormativity, an ideology that positions cisgender
    identities as a norm, is used in relation to the gender minority
    stress framework to describe the marginalizing nature of social
    environments for trans and gender diverse people. This article
    provides a critical review that integrates and expands on past
    theoretical perspectives on gender minority stressors and protective
    factors. Specifically, this article demonstrates the relevance of
    cultural and ethnic backgrounds to complement the application of
    intersectionality in research on health disparities experienced by
    trans and gender diverse people.

- abstract: Introduction International evidence has found large mental
    health inequities among transgender people and demonstrates that
    mental health outcomes are associated with enacted stigma
    experiences and protective factors. This study aimed to examine the
    extent of associations of enacted stigma experiences specific to
    transgender people alongside protective factors with mental health
    of transgender people in Aotearoa/New Zealand.Methods The 2018
    Counting Ourselves survey was a nationwide community-based study of
    transgender people (N = 1178, Mage = 29.5) living in Aotearoa/New
    Zealand. The survey assessed a wide range of gender minority stress
    experiences and protective factors that comprised primary (support
    from friends and family) and secondary social ties (neighborhood and
    transgender community belongingness). We calculated the predicted
    probabilities that transgender people exhibit very high
    psychological distress level, non-suicidal self-injury, and suicidal
    risks with different combinations and exposure profiles of enacted
    stigma and protective factors.Results Our findings demonstrated that
    enacted stigma was associated with negative mental health, and
    support of friends and family was linked to better outcomes across
    all mental health measures. Beyond primary social ties, sense of
    belongingness to neighborhood and transgender communities were
    linked to reduced odds of psychological distress and suicidal
    ideation. For those scoring high on enacted stigma and low on
    protective factors, our model revealed a 25% probability of
    attempting suicide in the last year compared to 3% for those scoring
    low on enacted stigma and high on protective factors.Conclusions
    Echoing previous findings, this study demonstrates that transgender
    people across Aotearoa/New Zealand are less likely to manifest
    life-threatening mental health outcomes if they experience low
    levels of enacted stigma and high levels of access to protective
    factors. Our findings suggest a need to address the enacted stigma
    that transgender people face across interpersonal and structural
    settings, and also to enhance social supports that are gender
    affirmative for this population.

- abstract: The Division of Clinical Psychology (DCP) of the British
    Psychological Society (BPS) invited Professor Ken Zucker as a
    keynote speaker to their annual conference in December 2010 (BPS,
    2010). Zucker works at the Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental
    Health (CAMH) and is considered an authoritative figure in the
    controversial diagnosis and 'treatment' of children with 'Gender
    Identity Disorder' (Hill et al. 2006). He is also Chair of the
    American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Sexual and Gender Identity
    Disorders Work Group for the DSM-5 (APA, 2010). His invitation was
    proposed by the DCP conference committee 'expert group' who research
    potential speakers for the division (J. Unwin, personal
    communication, November 15, 2010). This invitation sparked an angry
    and concerned response from many. Zucker's work at the CAMH GID
    clinic has been widely criticised by academics (e.g. Wilson, 2000;
    Wren, 2002; Menvielle & Tuerk, 2002; Hird, 2003; Langer & Martin,
    2004; Lev, 2005; Bryant, 2008), organisations (e.g. Burleton, 2008;
    Choe, 2008; Queerty, 2009) and individuals concerned with LGBT
    issues and gender diversity.

- abstract: Background Pediatric gender identity has gained increased
    attention over the past several years in the popular media,
    political arena, and medical literature. This article reviews
    terminology in this evolving field, traditional models of gender
    identity development and their limitations, epidemiology and natural
    history of cross-gender identification among children and
    adolescents, co-occurring conditions and behaviors, research into
    the biological and psychosocial determinants of cross-gender
    identification, and research into the options regarding and benefits
    of clinical approaches to gender incongruent youth. Methods Based on
    a critical review of the extant literature, both theoretical and
    empirical, that addresses the issue of pediatric gender identity,
    the authors synthesized what is presently known and what is in need
    of further research in order to elucidate the developmental
    trajectory and clinical needs of gender diverse youth. Results The
    field of pediatric gender identity has evolved substantially over
    the past several years. New research suggests that cross-gender
    identification is prevalent (approximately 1% of youth). These youth
    suffer disproportionately high rates of anxiety, depression, and
    suicidality. Although research into the etiology of cross-gender
    identification is limited, emerging data have shown that affirmative
    treatment protocols may improve the high rates of mental health
    difficulties seen among these patients. Conclusions The field of
    pediatric gender identity has evolved dramatically. Emerging data
    suggest that these patients' high rates of anxiety, depression, and
    suicidality appear to be improved with affirmative protocols,
    although future longitudinal data are needed.

- abstract: "Purpose: We aimed to assess the Minority Stress Model which
    proposes that the stress of experiencing stigma leads to adverse
    mental health outcomes, but social supports (e.g., school and family
    connectedness) will reduce this negative effect.Methods: We measured
    stigma-related experiences, social supports, and mental health
    (self-injury, suicide, depression, and anxiety) among a sample of
    923 Canadian transgender 14- to 25-year-old adolescents and young
    adults using a bilingual online survey. Logistic regression models
    were conducted to analyze the relationship between these risk and
    protective factors and dichotomous mental health outcomes among two
    separate age groups, 14- to 18-year-old and 19- to 25-year-old
    participants.Results: Experiences of discrimination, harassment, and
    violence (enacted stigma) were positively related to mental health
    problems and social support was negatively associated with mental
    health problems in all models among both age groups. Among 14--18
    year olds, we examined school connectedness, family connectedness,
    and perception of friends caring separately, and family
    connectedness was always the strongest protective predictor in
    multivariate models. In all the mental health outcomes we examined,
    transgender youth reporting low levels of enacted stigma experiences
    and high levels of protective factors tended to report favorable
    mental health outcomes. Conversely, the majority of participants
    reporting high levels of enacted stigma and low levels of protective
    factors reported adverse mental health outcomes.Conclusion: While
    these findings are limited by nonprobability sampling procedures and
    potential additional unmeasured risk and protective factors, the
    results provide positive evidence for the Minority Stress Model in
    this population and affirm the need for policies and programs to
    support schools and families to support transgender youth."

- abstract: The transgender population has been subject to a troubled
    history of ethically and methodologically flawed research practices.
    Whilst interest and ethical standards have both risen, there remains
    little specific methodological consideration of research with
    transgender participants. This article draws on practical
    experiences of doing research with transgender communities, and
    insider group status, to construct six categories to consider when
    working on trans-focused research. These categories include the
    importance of transgender history, the assurance of transparency,
    the significance of nuanced language use, the benefits of feminist
    methodological contributions, the value of intersectionality and the
    necessity of respecting trans spaces. The article concludes by
    reflecting on the overlapping and non-exhaustive nature of these
    categories, and wider structural concerns that may trouble knowledge
    production more generally.

- abstract: The process used to locate and recruit participants in a
    qualitative study is important for controlling bias and for
    efficiently obtaining a representative sample. In complex societies
    without clearly bounded groups from which to sample, participant
    recruitment requires especially careful consideration. Yet few
    qualitative researchers discuss their recruitment methods. This
    paper describes a site-based procedure for locating, selecting, and
    recruiting participants for qualitative research for communitybased
    research in contemporary societies. An example of this procedure
    applied in a study of nutrition and health among older adults of two
    rural counties in North Carolina is presented. Additional uses for
    this procedure are discussed.

- abstract: "Purpose: Gender-affirming surgeries and hormone therapy are
    medically necessary treatments to alleviate gender dysphoria;
    however, significant gaps exist in the research and clinical
    literature on surgery utilization and age of hormone therapy
    initiation among transgender adults.Methods: We conducted a
    retrospective review of electronic health record data from a random
    sample of 201 transgender patients of ages 18--64 years who
    presented for primary care between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2015
    (inclusive) at an urban community health center in Boston, MA. Fifty
    percent in our analyses were trans masculine (TM), 50% trans
    feminine, and 24% reported a genderqueer/nonbinary gender identity.
    Regression models were fit to assess demographic, gender
    identity-related, sexual history, and mental health correlates of
    gender-affirming surgery and of age of hormone therapy
    initiation.Results: Overall, 95% of patients were prescribed
    hormones by their primary care provider, and the mean age of
    initiation of masculinizing or feminizing hormone prescriptions was
    31.8 years (SD=11.1). Younger age of initiation of hormone
    prescriptions was associated with being TM, being a student,
    identifying as straight/heterosexual, having casual sexual partners,
    and not having past alcohol use disorder. Approximately one-third
    (32%) had a documented history of gender-affirming surgery. Factors
    associated with increased odds of surgery were older age, higher
    income levels, not identifying as bisexual, and not having a current
    psychotherapist.Conclusion: This study extends our understanding of
    prevalence and factors associated with gender-affirming treatments
    among transgender adults seeking primary care. Findings can inform
    future interventions to expand delivery of clinical care for
    transgender patients."

- abstract: Despite the burgeoning scholarship on transgender health and
    health care, the literature on transgender reproduction and
    reproductive medicine remains limited. In this narrative literature
    review, we examine recently published studies focused on the
    pregnancy and birth experiences of transgender men to provide an
    overview of the literature's major contributions and illuminate the
    gaps that exist within this research. Our review reveals that
    transgender men face substantial obstacles to achieving pregnancy
    and significant challenges during pregnancy and birth, which are
    informed by institutionalized cisnormativity embedded within medical
    norms and practices. This article demonstrates the importance of
    better understanding transgender men's reproductive health care
    needs in order to improve the quality of pregnancy-related health
    care delivery to this population. Our findings also provide insight
    for researchers, health care providers, and educators seeking to
    create and enhance gender-affirming medical education and training.

- abstract: Purpose Little is known about the reproductive desires of
    transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) adolescents who may seek
    gender-affirming medical care that leads to infertility. The current
    study addressed this gap by examining attitudes toward fertility and
    family formation in a diverse sample of TGNC youth. Method An online
    survey about sexual/reproductive health in sexual and gender
    minority (SGM) adolescents ages 14--17 years was conducted from
    September to October 2016. Results A total of 156 TGNC adolescents
    (Mage = 16.1 years; 83.3% assigned female at birth; 58.3% youth of
    color) responded. Overall, 70.5% of TGNC adolescents were interested
    in adoption and 35.9% in biological parenthood; more
    gender-nonconforming youth (43.8%) than transgender youth (25.8%)
    expressed interest in biological fertility. Discussions with
    health-care providers about fertility and reproductive health were
    uncommon---only 20.5% of youth had discussed fertility in general
    and only 13.5% had discussed effects of hormones on fertility.
    However, 60.9% of respondents were interested in learning more about
    their fertility and family building options. Key themes emerging
    from qualitative comments included concerns related to
    fertility/reproductive health (e.g., stigma of SGM parenthood,
    effect of gender-affirming treatments on fertility), and the need
    for additional reproductive health information both tailored to
    their individual experience and for SGM individuals more generally.
    Discussion TGNC adolescents expressed interest in multiple family
    building options, including adoption and biological parenthood, and
    identified a need for more information about these options. Thus,
    clinicians working with adolescents should be aware of the unique
    fertility and reproductive health needs of TGNC youth.

- abstract: "Introduction Like members of any other population,
    transgender and gender variant people - individuals whose gender
    identity varies from the traditional norm or from the sex they were
    assigned at birth - often seek parenthood. Little is known about the
    decision making and experiences of these individuals, including
    male-identified and gender-variant natal females who wish to achieve
    parenthood by carrying a pregnancy. This pilot qualitative study
    used grounded theory methodology to explore the conception,
    pregnancy, and birth experiences of this population of parents.
    Methods A grounded theory methodology was used to guide data
    collection and analysis. Eight male-identified or gender-variant
    gestational parents participated in the study. Data collection
    included individual 60-minute to 90-minute interviews conducted by
    recorded online video calls, as well as a self-administered online
    demographic survey. Data were collected from September 2011 through
    May 2012. Data saturation was achieved at 6 interviews, after which
    2 more interviews were conducted. The interviews were transcribed
    verbatim, and a constant comparative method was used to analyze the
    interview transcripts. Results Loneliness was the overarching theme
    that permeated participants' experiences, social interactions, and
    emotional responses during every stage of achieving biologic
    parenthood. Within this context of loneliness, participants
    described complex internal and external processes of navigating
    identity. Navigating identity encapsulated 2 subthemes: undergoing
    internal struggles and engaging with the external world. The
    preconception period was identified as participants' time of
    greatest distress and least involvement with health care. Discussion
    The findings of this study suggest that culturally-sensitive
    preconception counseling could be beneficial for transgender and
    gender-variant individuals. The grounded theory produced by this
    pilot investigation also provides insights that will be useful to
    health care providers and others working with male-identified and
    gender-variant prospective parents."

- abstract: In this article, the authors describe how they used a hybrid
    process of inductive and deductive thematic analysis to interpret
    raw data in a doctoral study on the role of performance feedback in
    the self-assessment of nursing practice. The methodological approach
    integrated data-driven codes with theory-driven ones based on the
    tenets of social phenomenology. The authors present a detailed
    exemplar of the staged process of data coding and identification of
    themes. This process demonstrates how analysis of the raw data from
    interview transcripts and organizational documents progressed toward
    the identification of overarching themes that captured the
    phenomenon of performance feedback as described by participants in
    the study.

- abstract: Some transgender men retain their uterus, get pregnant, and
    give birth. However, societal attitudes about gender have erected
    barriers to openly being pregnant and giving birth as a transgender
    man. Little research exists regarding transgender men's reproductive
    needs. Anecdotal observations suggest that social change and
    increasing empowerment of transgender men may result in increasing
    frequency and openness about pregnancy and birth. Specific needs
    around conception, pregnancy, and newborn care may arise from
    transphobia, exogenous testosterone exposure, or from having had (or
    desiring) gender-affirming surgery. We undertook a qualitative study
    to understand the needs of transgender men who had given birth.

- abstract: "OBJECTIVE:  To conduct a cross-sectional study of
    transgender men who had been pregnant and delivered after
    transitioning from female-to-male gender to help guide practice and
    further investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  We administered a
    web-based survey from March to December 2013 to inquire about
    demographics, hormone use, fertility, pregnancy experience, and
    birth outcomes. Participants were not required to have been on
    hormone therapy to be eligible. We used a mixed-methods approach to
    evaluate the quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS:  Forty-one
    self-described transgender men completed the survey. Before
    pregnancy, 61% (n=25) had used testosterone. Mean age at conception
    was 28 years with a standard deviation of 6.8 years. Eighty-eight
    percent of oocytes (n=36) came from participants' own ovaries. Half
    of the participants received prenatal care from a physician and 78%
    delivered in a hospital. Qualitative themes included low levels of
    health care provider awareness and knowledge about the unique needs
    of pregnant transgender men as well as a desire for resources to
    support transgender men through their pregnancy. CONCLUSION: 
    Transgender men are achieving pregnancy after having socially,
    medically, or both transitioned. Themes from this study can be used
    to develop transgender-appropriate services and interventions that
    may improve the health and health care experiences of transgender
    men."

  type: book
- abstract: "Background: Transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive
    (TGE) people experience pregnancy. Quantitative data about pregnancy
    intentions and outcomes of TGE people are needed to identify
    patterns in pregnancy intentions and outcomes and to inform
    clinicians how best to provide gender-affirming and competent
    pregnancy care. Aims: We sought to collect data on pregnancy
    intentions and outcomes among TGE people assigned female or intersex
    at birth in the United States. Methods: Collaboratively with a
    study-specific community advisory team, we designed a customizable,
    online survey to measure sexual and reproductive health experiences
    among TGE people. Eligible participants included survey respondents
    who identified as a man or within the umbrella of transgender,
    nonbinary, or gender-expansive identities; were 18 years or older;
    able to complete an electronic survey in English; lived in the
    United States; and were assigned female or intersex at birth.
    Participants were recruited through The PRIDE Study - a national,
    online, longitudinal cohort study of sexual and gender minority
    people - and externally via online social media postings, TGE
    community e-mail distribution lists, in-person TGE community events,
    and academic and community conferences. We conducted descriptive
    analyses of pregnancy-related outcomes and report frequencies
    overall and by racial and ethnic identity, pregnancy intention, or
    testosterone use. Results: Out of 1,694 eligible TGE respondents who
    provided reproductive history data, 210 (12%) had been pregnant. Of
    these, 115 (55%) had one prior pregnancy, 47 (22%) had two prior
    pregnancies, and 48 (23%) had three or more prior pregnancies. Of
    the 433 pregnancies, 169 (39%) resulted in live birth, 142 (33%)
    miscarried, 92 (21%) ended in abortion, two (0.5%) ended in
    stillbirth, two (0.5%) had an ectopic pregnancy, and seven (2%) were
    still pregnant; nineteen pregnancies (4%) had an unknown outcome.
    Among live births, 39 (23%) were delivered via cesarean section.
    Across all pregnancies, 233 (54%) were unintended. Fifteen
    pregnancies occurred after initiation of testosterone, and four
    pregnancies occurred while taking testosterone. Among all
    participants, 186 (11%) wanted a future pregnancy, and 275 (16%)
    were unsure; 182 (11%) felt \\\"at risk\\\" for an unintended pregnancy.
    Discussion: TGE people in the United States plan for pregnancy,
    experience pregnancy (intended and unintended) and all pregnancy
    outcomes, and are engaged in family building. Sexual and
    reproductive health clinicians and counselors should avoid
    assumptions about pregnancy capacity or intentions based on a
    patient's presumed or stated gender or engagement with
    gender-affirming hormone therapy."

- abstract: We aim to make evident that solely referencing cisgender
    women in the context of sexual and reproductive health-particularly
    pregnancy planning and care-excludes a diverse group of transgender
    and gender nonbinary people who have sexual and reproductive health
    needs and experiences that can be similar to but also unique from
    those of cisgender women. We call on clinicians and researchers to
    ensure that all points of sexual and reproductive health access,
    research, sources of information, and care delivery comprehensively
    include and are accessible to people of all genders. We describe
    barriers to sexual and reproductive health care and research
    participation unique to people of marginalized gender identities,
    provide examples of harm resulting from these barriers, and offer
    concrete suggestions for creating inclusive, accurate, and
    respectful care and research environments-which will lead to higher
    quality health care and science for people of all genders.

    eugenics in state statutes, this Article aims to make several
    contributions to issues at the intersection of the LGBT and
    reproductive health, rights, and justice movements. This Article
    will show how the reproductive health issues of transgender people
    remain shadowed in the mainstream LGBT movement and reproductive
    health and rights movement. This Article will use reproductive
    justice principles to provide new entry points for LGBT advocates
    and reproductive health and rights advocates to build alliances
    around gender, sexuality, and reproduction by highlighting
    opportunities for reproductive justice advocates to engage on
    reproductive health and rights issues facing transgender people.
    Finally, this Article will anticipate and explore areas in which
    reproductive health, rights, and justice advocates may resist such
    alliances.

- abstract: Transgender people have experienced significant advances in
    societal acceptance despite experiencing continued stigma and
    discrimination. While it can still be difficult to access quality
    health care, and there is a great deal to be done to create
    affirming health care organizations, there is growing interest
    around the United States in advancing transgender health. The focus
    of this commentary is to provide guidance to clinicians caring for
    transgender men or other gender nonconforming people who are
    contemplating, carrying, or have completed a pregnancy. Terms
    transgender and gender nonconforming specifically refer to those
    whose gender identity (e.g., being a man) differs from their female
    sex assigned at birth. Many, if not most transgender men retain
    their female reproductive organs and retain the capacity to have
    children. Review of their experience demonstrates the need for
    preconception counseling that includes discussion of stopping
    testosterone while trying to conceive and during pregnancy, and
    anticipating increasing experiences of gender dysphoria during and
    after pregnancy. The clinical aspects of delivery itself fall within
    the realm of routine obstetrical care, although further research is
    needed into how mode and environment of delivery may affect gender
    dysphoria. Postpartum considerations include discussion of options
    for chest (breast) feeding, and how and when to reinitiate
    testosterone. A positive perinatal experience begins from the moment
    transgender men first present for care and depends on comprehensive
    affirmation of gender diversity.

- abstract: A growing body of literature supports stigma and
    discrimination as fundamental causes of health disparities. Stigma
    and discrimination experienced by transgender people have been
    associated with increased risk for depression, suicide, and HIV.
    Transgender stigma and discrimination experienced in health care
    influence transgender people's health care access and utilization.
    Thus, understanding how stigma and discrimination manifest and
    function in health care encounters is critical to addressing health
    disparities for transgender people. A qualitative, grounded theory
    approach was taken to this study of stigma in health care
    interactions. Between January and July 2011, fifty-five transgender
    people and twelve medical providers participated in one-time
    in-depth interviews about stigma, discrimination, and health care
    interactions between providers and transgender patients. Due to the
    social and institutional stigma against transgender people, their
    care is excluded from medical training. Therefore, providers
    approach medical encounters with transgender patients with
    ambivalence and uncertainty. Transgender people anticipate that
    providers will not know how to meet their needs. This uncertainty
    and ambivalence in the medical encounter upsets the normal balance
    of power in provider-patient relationships. Interpersonal stigma
    functions to reinforce the power and authority of the medical
    provider during these interactions. Functional theories of stigma
    posit that we hold stigmatizing attitudes because they serve
    specific psychological functions. However, these theories ignore how
    hierarchies of power in social relationships serve to maintain and
    reinforce inequalities. The findings of this study suggest that
    interpersonal stigma also functions to reinforce medical power and
    authority in the face of provider uncertainty. Within functional
    theories of stigma, it is important to acknowledge the role of power
    and to understand how stigmatizing attitudes function to maintain
    systems of inequality that contribute to health disparities.

- abstract: "Background: Transgender stigma is rampant within healthcare
    systems in the United States. Transgender adults assigned female at
    birth -- including those identifying as transmasculine or non-binary
    -- face unique barriers, such as stigma when accessing sexual and
    reproductive healthcare labeled as being for \"women.\" However,
    transgender and non-binary people are not passive victims to this
    stigma, and the medical community would benefit from understanding
    the actions this population takes to resist and reduce transgender
    stigma in healthcare. Yet, little research has attempted to
    understand such actions.Aims: This qualitative study aims to explore
    how transmasculine and non-binary adults are actively resisting and
    reducing the impact of transgender stigma in healthcare.Methods:
    In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25
    transmasculine and non-binary adults assigned female at birth who
    were living in a metropolitan area in the mid-Atlantic United
    States. The research team analyzed qualitative interview data using
    content analysis.Results: The 25 participants ranged in age from 21
    to 57, with an average age of 33 years old. Six themes were
    identified related to resisting and reducing transgender stigma in
    healthcare: (a) using social support; (b) persistence to meet one's
    own needs; (c) avoiding mainstream healthcare; (d) advocacy; (e)
    doing one's own research; and (f) strategic disclosure of
    transgender/non-binary identity. We detail how privilege and
    intersectionality connect to the use of these strategies.Discussion:
    Findings indicate there is value in using peer advocates and peer
    health literacy; in developing and nurturing support groups related
    to transgender/non-binary health; in developing \"allies\" employed
    within the healthcare system; in creating and maintaining lists of
    culturally responsive health providers and resources about
    navigating the healthcare system; and in offering trainings related
    to self-advocacy and health-related activism. These findings can be
    used to inform future health prevention and intervention efforts
    with transmasculine and non-binary adults."

- abstract: "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify factors associated
    with the reproductive planning of trans-masculine adults. STUDY
    DESIGN: Between 2015 and 2016, providers enrolled 150
    trans-masculine adults in a sexual health study assessing
    sociodemographics, social support, gender affirmation, sexual
    partnering, and reproductive history and planning. A brief clinical
    interview assessed contraceptive use and concerns. Bivariate and
    multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations
    between participant characteristics and three outcomes: current
    contraceptive use, lifetime pregnancy history and reproductive
    planning. RESULTS: Overall, 37.3% are currently using
    contraceptives; 5.3% have been pregnant; and 20.0% plan to have
    biological children (9.3% plan to become pregnant; 12.0% plan to use
    their oocytes with a surrogate). Participants are less likely to use
    contraceptives if they are students vs. not, have socially affirmed
    their gender vs. not and have a partner vs. are single. Greater
    number of sexual partners is associated with the increased odds of
    contraceptive use. Further, as social support increases, the odds of
    having been pregnant decreases. Participants with a nonbinary gender
    identity are more likely to want to become pregnant than those with
    a binary gender identity, whereas those who have socially affirmed
    their gender are less likely to want to become pregnant than those
    who had not. Finally, participants of color more commonly planned to
    use their oocytes with a surrogate than white participants.
    CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic, gender affirmation, social support and
    sexual partner factors are associated with contraceptive use and
    reproductive history among trans-masculine patients. IMPLICATIONS:
    Healthcare providers must be aware of the diverse reproductive
    histories and pregnancy goals of trans-masculine individuals in
    order to provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare counseling
    and provision. More research is needed to better understand
    contraception and reproduction desires in trans-masculine
    individuals."

- abstract: Gender affirming medical and surgical treatments affect the
    reproductive potential of transgender individuals. Prior to the
    development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), genital
    gender-affirming surgery frequently eliminated a patient's
    reproductive potential. Today, all patients should be counseled on
    their fertility preservation (FP) options before medical and
    surgical transition, yet this appears to seldom occur in practice.
    The following review is the result of a systematic literature search
    of PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar to identify current and future
    FP options, barriers to treatment patients face, practice patterns
    of transgender health care providers, and if there were any
    standardized counseling protocols. Options for transwomen at any
    point in their transition range from simply providing a semen sample
    to be used with assistive reproductive techniques to experimental
    techniques involving testicular cryopreservation followed by in
    vitro initiation of spermatogenesis. Transmen before and after
    starting hormone therapy can pursue any assistive reproductive
    techniques available for ciswomen. Future options currently under
    investigation include ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) with in
    vitro oocyte maturation. In addition to counseling about their FP
    options, patients should be advised prospectively about the
    requirements, process details, the total costs associated with
    achieving pregnancy, and the inherent risks associated with using
    preserved genetic material including risk of failure, and maternal
    and fetal health risks. Transgender patients report using assistive
    reproductive services difficult, due to a lack of dialogue about
    fertility and the lack of information offered to them- presumably
    because their circumstances do not fit into a traditional narrative
    familiar to providers. Physicians and health care providers would
    benefit from better educational tools to help transgender patients
    make informed decisions and better training about transgender
    patients in general, and FP options available to them.

- abstract: "Background: Medical school and residency curricula are
    lacking in content on the care of the transgender patient. As a
    result, many providers do not have enough experience and knowledge
    to adequately care for this patient population. The aim of this
    study was to assess gynecologists' preferences and knowledge base
    with regard to transgender healthcare.Methods: This was a
    cross-sectional survey of obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN)
    providers. An anonymous survey was sent via electronic mail to nine
    academic OBGYN departments across the United States. Survey
    questions were designed to assess provider experience and practice
    environment, education about transgender health practices, personal
    experience with transgender patients, and knowledge base regarding
    current recommendations for the care of gender minority
    patients.Results: Of the 352 providers who received the survey, 141
    responded, for a 40.1% response rate. Of the respondents, 61.7% (87
    of 141) were generalist OBGYNs, and 86% (117 of 136) practiced in an
    academic institution; 80% (113 of 141) did not receive training in
    residency on the care of transgender patients. Time in practice was
    not associated with having learned about transgender care. Only
    35.3% and 29% were comfortable caring for male-to-female and
    female-to-male transsexual patients, respectively; and, 88.7% and
    80.4% were willing to perform screening Pap smears on female-to-male
    transsexual patients and routine breast examinations on
    male-to-female patients, respectively. Eighty-two of 138 providers
    (59.4%) did not know the recommendations for breast cancer screening
    in male-to-female patients.Conclusions: Efforts should be made to
    educate trainees on the important aspects of transgender care, and
    comprehensive guidelines should be published for practicing
    providers."

- abstract: "BACKGROUND: Hormonal therapy and sex reassignment surgery
    (SRS) in transsexual persons lead to an irreversible loss of their
    reproductive potential. The current and future technologies could
    create the possibility for female-to-male transsexual persons
    (transsexual men) to have genetically related children. However,
    little is known about this topic. The aim of this study is to
    provide information on the reproductive wishes of transsexual men
    after SRS. METHODS A self-constructed questionnaire was presented to
    50 transsexual men in a single-center study. RESULTS: The majority
    (64%) of transsexual men were currently involved in a relationship.
    Eleven participants (22.0%) reported having children. For eight
    participants, their female partner was inseminated with donor sperm,
    whereas three participants gave birth before hormonal therapy and
    SRS. At the time of interview, more than half of the participants
    desired to have children (54%). There were 18 participants (37.5%)
    who reported that they had considered freezing their germ cells, if
    this technique would have been available previously. Participants
    without children at the time of investigation expressed this desire
    more often than participants with children (χ²; test: P= 0.006).
    CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that the majority of transsexual men
    desire to have children. Therefore, more attention should be paid to
    this topic during the diagnostic phase of transition and to the
    consequences for genetic parenthood after starting sex reassignment
    therapy."

- abstract: The Standards of Care (SOC) for the Health of Transsexual,
    Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People is a publication of the
    World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). The
    overall goal of the SOC is to provide clinical guidance for health
    professionals to assist transsexual, transgender, and gender
    nonconforming people with safe and effective pathways to achieving
    lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves, in order to
    maximize their overall health, psychological well-being, and
    self-fulfillment. This assistance may include primary care,
    gynecologic and urologic care, reproductive options, voice and
    communication therapy, mental health services (e.g., assessment,
    counseling, psychotherapy), and hormonal and surgical treatments.
    The SOC are based on the best available science and expert
    professional consensus. Because most of the research and experience
    in this field comes from a North American and Western European
    perspective, adaptations of the SOC to other parts of the world are
    necessary. The SOC articulate standards of care while acknowledging
    the role of making informed choices and the value of harm reduction
    approaches. In addition, this version of the SOC recognizes that
    treatment for gender dysphoria i.e., discomfort or distress that is
    caused by a discrepancy between persons gender identity and that
    persons sex assigned at birth (and the associated gender role and/or
    primary and secondary sex characteristics) has become more
    individualized. Some individuals who present for care will have made
    significant self-directed progress towards gender role changes or
    other resolutions regarding their gender identity or gender
    dysphoria. Other individuals will require more intensive services.
    Health professionals can use the SOC to help patients consider the
    full range of health services open to them, in accordance with their
    clinical needs and goals for gender expression.

- abstract: Although informed consent models for prescribing hormone
    replacement therapy are becoming increasingly prevalent, many
    physicians continue to require an assessment and referral letter
    from a mental health professional prior to prescription. Drawing on
    personal and communal experience, the author argues that assessment
    and referral requirements are dehumanising and unethical,
    foregrounding the ways in which these requirements evidence a
    mistrust of trans people, suppress the diversity of their
    experiences and sustain an unjustified double standard in contrast
    to other forms of clinical care. Physicians should abandon this
    unethical requirement in favour of an informed consent approach to
    transgender care.

- abstract: "Background Gender euphoria is an important experience and
    concept for many, especially transgender and/or nonbinary
    individuals, but has not received much attention from psychological
    and clinical research. In contrast to gender dysphoria, which
    originates in psychiatry, the term \"gender euphoria\" has been
    mobilized by some LGBTQ people to describe the powerfully positive
    emotions that can come from one's gender/sex. As such, researchers
    and clinicians may benefit from conceptual clarity as to what gender
    euphoria is and what kinds of experiences might result in gender
    euphoria.Aim We aimed to better understand how trans community
    members and others conceptualize the term \"gender euphoria,\"
    including its relationship to gender dysphoria, as well as the
    contexts and behaviors that elicit gender euphoria.Method We
    administered an online qualitative survey to participants (N = 47)
    of diverse sexualities and gender/sexes (including transgender,
    cisgender, and/or nonbinary participants) who had heard of or used
    the term \"gender euphoria.\" Participants answered open-ended
    questions about where they had heard the term being used, how they
    would define gender euphoria and gender dysphoria, the relation
    between these terms, and their gender euphoric experiences.Results
    Analyses resulted in five themes: (1) gender euphoria describes a
    joyful feeling of rightness in one's gender/sex, (2) gender euphoric
    experiences can be external, internal, and/or social, (3) \"gender
    euphoria\" originated in and circulates in online and in-person
    gender/sex minority communities, (4) dysphoria describes a negative
    feeling of conflict between gender/sexed aspects of one's self, and
    (5) the relationship between euphoria and dysphoria is
    complex.Discussion These results can inform qualitative and
    quantitative research, gender affirmative clinical practice,
    political fights for transgender rights, and understandings of
    gendered experiences for people of all identities."

- abstract: Purpose Hair removal procedures, including electrolysis and
    laser hair removal, are the most commonly pursued gender-affirmative
    medical interventions by transfeminine people, but previous
    empirical studies have not examined their relationship to
    psychological well-being. Materials and Methods Participants were
    281 transfeminine adults in the United States who responded to an
    online questionnaire. Results Satisfaction with one's current state
    of hair removal was negatively correlated with situational body
    image dysphoria, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and negative
    affect, and positively correlated with positive affect. Conclusions
    Results of this study suggest that hair removal is associated with
    both decreased distress but also increased subjective well-being
    (e.g. higher positive affect). Though the construct of 'gender
    euphoria' has been introduced in previous publications, it has thus
    far not been rigorously defined or operationalized within health
    research. These results suggest that gender euphoria can be
    understood in terms of increased subjective well-being associated
    with gender affirmation, including gender-affirmative medical
    interventions. This study demonstrates a significant association
    between hair removal services and depression symptoms, anxiety
    symptoms, situational body image dysphoria, positive affect, and
    negative affect in transfeminine adults. These findings cast
    significant doubt on the assertion that hair removal services for
    transfeminine people are 'cosmetic.'

- abstract: Gender dysphoria is distress due to a discrepancy between
    one's assigned gender and gender identity. Adults who wish to access
    gender clinics are assessed to ensure they meet the diagnostic
    criteria for gender dysphoria. Therefore, the definition of gender
    dysphoria has a significant impact on the lives of individuals who
    wish to undergo physical gender transition. This systematic review
    aimed to identify and synthesize all existing qualitative research
    literature about the lived experience of gender dysphoria in adults.
    A pre-planned systematic search identified 1491 papers, with 20 of
    those meeting full inclusion criteria, and a quality assessment of
    each paper was conducted. Data pertaining to the lived experience of
    gender dysphoria were extracted from each paper and a
    meta-ethnographic synthesis was conducted. Four overarching concepts
    were identified; distress due to dissonance of assigned and
    experienced gender; interface of assigned gender, gender identity
    and society; social consequences of gender identity; internal
    processing of rejection, and transphobia. A key finding was the
    reciprocal relationship between an individual's feelings about their
    gender and societal responses to transgender people. Other subthemes
    contributing to distress were misgendering, mismatch between gender
    identity and societal expectations, and hypervigilance for
    transphobia.

- abstract: In the DSM-5, there has been a change in the diagnosis for
    transpeople of all ages from Gender Identity Disorder (GID) to
    Gender Dysphoria (GD), in part to better indicate the distress that
    transpeople may experience when their gender identity feels
    incongruent. The Workgroup for Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders,
    chaired by Kenneth J. Zucker, was employed by the American
    Psychiatric Association (APA) to update the DSM-5's GID diagnosis
    reflecting contemporary scientific knowledge. Additionally, in a
    pre-publication report to the APA, members of the Workgroup
    suggested that they would also be concerned with the
    destigmatization of transpeople while preserving a diagnosis that
    medical insurance companies would accept for issuing payments for
    transitioning treatments (Drescher, 2013). The aims of this article
    are, firstly, to question whether changing the diagnosis lessens the
    stigmatization of transpeople. I will suggest that the semantic
    change from GID to GD marks "inverted" gendered expressions as
    pathological and, thus, continues to stigmatize transpeople.
    Secondly, the article explores the development of the GD diagnosis,
    and illustrates how the scientific data this were founded on are
    contentious. The article then demonstrates how the trans
    anti-pathologization movement has challenged the perceived
    pathologizing effects of the DSM-5 classification of GD. The article
    examines a selection of Western transgender community advocates'
    websites, forums, and blogs. From these sources, the article then
    explores the different narratives of transpeople and political
    groups who offer details of their praxis, and evidences how the
    trans anti-pathologization advocates use the available science and
    human rights discourses to contest the role of psychiatry in the
    treatment of transpeople.

- abstract: "Background: Transgender microaffirmations are subtle
    endorsements of a person's gender identity through both verbal
    acknowledgements and behavioral gestures. Microaffirmations
    positively impact individuals who identify as transgender by
    acknowledging their gender identity and by communicating a sense of
    support and validation.Aims: This study focuses on microaffirmations
    specifically directed toward nonbinary transgender individuals
    within romantic relationships.Methods: Participants included 161
    adults who identified as nonbinary: 85 who identified as gender
    nonconforming and 76 who identified as agender. These participants
    were either currently in a romantic relationship or had been in a
    romantic relationship within the past 5 years. Participants
    completed an online survey and provided examples of the
    microaffirmations they experienced from their romantic
    partners.Results: Responses were analyzed via thematic analysis,
    resulting in four overarching themes: (1) Identity Validations,
    acknowledgement and acceptance of nonbinary identity; (2) Identity
    Endorsements, active endorsements of nonbinary through language or
    behavior; (3) Active Learning, self-education about nonbinary
    identities; and (4) Active Defense, interruptions of others'
    negative actions directed at nonbinary partners.Discussion:
    Discussion of the results focuses on understanding how
    microaffirmations operate to complicate binary notions of gender/sex
    and positively influence nonbinary transgender individuals in
    interpersonal relationships."

- abstract: "The present study aimed to expand current understandings of
    gender dysphoria by explicating the social context in which it is
    experienced and by centering the analysis on the lived experience of
    trans individuals. Data were collected online from a nonclinical
    sample composed of 610 transgender participants. Participants
    answered 2 open-ended prompts to describe their gender dysphoria as
    experienced in a social context. Thematic analysis was used to code
    the data and determine main themes. Four socially salient themes
    emerged regarding gender dysphoria: 1) External Triggers; 2)
    Internal Processing; 3) Interruption of Social Functioning; and 4)
    Moderated by Transition. When describing their experiences,
    participants identified external triggers for dysphoria that were
    social in nature as well as internal processes that occurred in
    response to those triggers. Often this led to an interruption of
    social functioning. For some of our participants, gender dysphoria
    was moderated by transition. Results of the present study suggest
    that trans individuals' experience of gender dysphoria is greatly
    impacted by social context. Discussion focuses on the way the
    present findings may be best understood in relation to the
    literature on minority stress. Consideration of gender dysphoria as
    a proximal stressor may help to conceptually disaggregate gender
    dysphoria from psychological stress in the way we frame mental
    health considerations for trans individuals. (PsycInfo Database

- abstract: High prevalence of psychological distress, including greater
    depression, lower self-esteem, and suicidal ideation, has been
    documented across numerous samples of transgender women and has been
    attributed to high rates of discrimination and violence. According
    to the gender affirmation framework (Sevelius, 2013), access to
    sources of gender-affirmative support can offset such negative
    psychological effects of social oppression. However, critical
    questions remain unanswered in regards to how and which aspects of
    gender affirmation are related to psychological well-being. The aims
    of this study were to investigate the associations among 3 discrete
    areas of gender affirmation (psychological, medical, and social) and
    participants' reports of psychological well-being. A community
    sample of 573 transgender women with a history of sex work completed
    a 1-time self-report survey that assessed demographic
    characteristics, gender affirmation, and mental health outcomes. In
    multivariate models, we found that social, psychological, and
    medical gender affirmation were significant predictors of lower
    depression and higher self-esteem whereas no domains of affirmation
    were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Findings
    support the need for accessible and affordable transitioning
    resources for transgender women to promote better quality of life
    among an already vulnerable population. However, transgender
    individuals should not be portrayed simplistically as objects of
    vulnerability, and research identifying mechanisms to promote
    wellness and thriving is necessary for future intervention
    development. As the gender affirmation framework posits, the
    personal experience of feeling affirmed as a transgender person
    results from individuals' subjective perceptions of need along
    multiple dimensions of gender affirmation. Thus, personalized
    assessment of gender affirmation may be a useful component of
    counseling and service provision for transgender women. (PsycInfo

- abstract: A dearth of research has explored concurrently the
    associations between multiple forms of gender affirmation (or
    transitioning) and the mental health of transgender adults. In 2015,
    288 U.S. transgender adults completed a cross-sectional, online
    survey assessing demographics, gender affirmation experiences, and
    mental health. Adjusting for age and discrimination experiences, we
    used mixed-effect logistic regression analyses to examine changes in
    self-reported suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and non-suicidal
    self-injury (NSSI) before and after initiating the gender
    affirmation process, and linear regression analyses to examine
    associations between gender affirmation experiences and
    self-reported depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Overall,
    81.3% of participants identified along the female-to-male, trans
    masculine gender spectrum (of which 20.9% identified as non-binary)
    and 18.8% identified along the male-to-female, trans feminine gender
    spectrum (of which 7.4% identified as non-binary). Nearly all
    participants (98.6%) reported disclosing their gender identity to
    family or a coworker; 67.4% endorsed recently using hormones, and
    31.3% endorsed a gender-affirming medical procedure. In
    multivariable models, participants were at greater odds of NSSI,
    contemplating suicide, and attempting suicide before initiating the
    gender affirmation process compared to after. In additional models,
    gender identity disclosure and medical procedure engagement were
    inversely associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, whereas
    gender identity disclosure, hormone use, and medical procedure
    engagement were inversely associated with stress symptoms. Finally,
    the number of gender affirmation experiences endorsed was inversely
    associated with depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Findings
    support the possibility that social and medical gender affirmation
    experiences may be protective against mental health problems in
    transgender adults.

- abstract: The medicalization of gender variance is a key force in
    transgender people's experiences of embodiment, identity, and
    community. While most directly dictating experiences of diagnosis
    and medical classification, it is important to acknowledge that the
    effects of medicalization are widespread across social contexts and
    institutions. I explore the medical model of transgender identity,
    with special attention to its current diagnostic classification, in
    order to highlight how transgender people's interactional
    experiences of gender are shaped by medical authority. I review
    literature that highlights the operation of the medical model as a
    normative accountability structure in its influence across multiple
    institutions of social life including health and healthcare,
    transgender community groups, and legal classification.

- abstract: While prior research has called attention to how medically
    based, normative understandings of sex and gender place undue
    restrictions on transgender people's autonomy, there has yet to be
    an attempt to consolidate this research into a recognizable concept
    that is situated within existing theoretical frameworks. This
    article uses documentary films focused on transgender men as an
    empirical example to develop the concept of transnormativity.
    Transnormativity describes the specific framework to which
    transgender people's presentations and experiences of gender are
    held accountable. Drawing on research specific to transgender
    community groups, medicalization, and legal transition, I argue that
    transnormativity structures transgender experience, identification,
    and narratives into a hierarchy of legitimacy that is dependent upon
    medical standards. This ideology, as I show via a content analysis
    of documentary films, circulates in media depictions of transgender
    people in ways that eclipse alternative explanations of gender
    non-conformity. While medical transition is a central component of
    many transgender people's gender trajectory, I argue in this article
    that the privileging of the medical model over others creates a
    marginalizing effect for gender-non-conforming people who cannot or
    do not wish to medically transition.

- abstract: Transgender individuals face severe stigma-driven health
    inequities structurally, institutionally, and interpersonally,
    yielding poor individual-level outcomes. Gender affirmation, or
    being recognized based on one's gender identity, expression, and/or
    role, may be considered a manifestation of resilience. To provide
    intervention and policy guidelines, we examined latent constructs
    representative of gender affirmation (legal documentation changes,
    transition-related medical procedures, familial support) and
    discrimination (unequal treatment, harassment, and attacks), and
    tested their impact on mental, physical, and behavioral health
    outcomes among 17,188 binary-identified transgender participants in
    the 2015 US Transgender Survey. Confirmatory factor analyses
    revealed high standardized factor loadings for both latent
    variables, on which we regressed outcomes using structural equation
    modeling. Fit indices suggested good model fit. Affirmation was
    associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation and psychological
    distress, and higher odds of substance use, and past-year healthcare
    use and HIV-testing. Discrimination was associated with higher odds
    of suicidal ideation, psychological distress, substance use, and
    past-year HIV-testing. Affirmation and discrimination interaction
    analyses showed lower odds of past-year suicidal ideation, with
    affirmation having a significant moderating protective effect
    against discrimination. Gender affirmation is paramount in upholding
    transgender health. Clarification of affirmation procedures, and
    increases in its accessibility, equitably across racial/ethnic
    groups, should become a priority, from policy to the family unit.
    The impact of discrimination demands continued advocacy via
    education and policy.

- abstract: The minority stress model describes the unique stressors
    that impact sexual and gender minorities above and beyond general
    stressors and includes both external (distal) and internal
    (proximal) sources of stress. Proximal stressors are the thoughts
    and feelings that are elicited and maintained because of direct and
    indirect experiences with prejudice events and are typically
    conceptualized to include anticipated stigma, internalized
    transphobia, and gender identity concealment. Recently, gender
    dysphoria has been proposed as a proximal stressor due to its
    interactive nature with both external triggers and mental health
    symptoms. However, gender dysphoria has not been tested empirically
    in prior published models of gender minority stress. Trans and
    nonbinary participants (N = 297) over the age of 18 were recruited
    via postings on social networking websites. Participants identified
    as trans feminine (n = 128), trans masculine (n = 110), nonbinary (n
    = 49), and agender (n = 10), and ranged in age from 18 to 67 (M =
    28, SD = 9.42). Through a confirmatory factor analysis, it was shown
    that internalized transphobia, anticipated stress, gender identity
    concealment, and gender dysphoria reflect the latent factor proximal
    stress. Findings from this study suggest that gender dysphoria
    should be understood as a proximal stressor. As such, clinical
    interventions that target how individuals internalize experiences in
    a cisnormative society could have a positive impact on the severity
    of gender dysphoria. Additionally, modeling gender dysphoria as a
    proximal stressor can help future research disaggregate gender
    dysphoria from negative mental health symptoms such as anxiety or
    rumination. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights

- abstract: Transgender people have long been associated with sexual
    perversion. For example, many early versions of the Diagnostic and
    Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) infamously categorized
    any gender variance as sexual deviance or paraphilia. This article
    therefore investigates the taxonomical movement away from the
    transgender subject as perverse toward the current diagnosis of
    gender dysphoria, which instead consolidates the transgender subject
    as distressed and suffering. Through an unconventional use of
    psychoanalytic theories of perversion, I argue that DSM-5's new
    diagnosis criteria work defensively, functioning as an antidote to
    the clinician's anxiety in the face of difference. When separated
    from stereotypical acts and identities, perversion proves to be
    quite valuable in understanding clinical transphobia. In particular,
    Freud's writings on fetishism and disavowal reveal some of the
    unconscious roles at play in the repeated medicalization of trans
    people and the restricting of transition-related resources. Through
    the donning of a fetish object, disavowal acts to ignore an
    upsetting reality while the traumatic truth remains intact. An
    analysis of Chase Joynt's video installation, Resisterectomy,
    provides grounded narratives of gendered surgery and illness that
    disrupt anticipated affects, temporalities, and curative measures.

In both medical and mainstream discussions, gender dysphoria is nearly synonymous with transness itself. Transgender people are born in the wrong body, so they experience great distress over their sex characteristics and use hormones and surgery to change their bodies and eliminate their distress---or so the story goes. But increasingly, trans communities and scholars are pushing back against this focus on dysphoria to make space for discussions of more positive aspects of trans experiences. Ashley (2019) has argued that demanding that trans patients present with gender dysphoria is dehumanizing, and that there are other valid reasons a trans person might pursue medical transition, such as gender euphoria or creative transfiguration. Similarly, Bradford, Rider, and Spencer (2019) have called for future research to go beyond deficit and distress-based models of trans identities. Both Ashley and Bradford, Rider, and Spencer use the term *gender euphoria* to describe positive gender-related emotions that might emerge from transitioning, a term that has become more common in trans communities in recent years. However, very little academic research has been done on the topic.

This research sought to fill this gap, and asked: How do trans individuals describe their experiences of euphoria, joy, affirmation, or positive affect in relation to their gender? To answer this question, we conducted an exploratory study using qualitative interviews with a small sample of young trans people living in British Columbia, Canada, about their experiences of gender euphoria. We found that gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from affirmation of one's gender identity or expression and can include a wide variety of emotions and experiences. Given these findings, we challenge pathologizing narratives of transness by illuminating the joys and positive reverberations that can come with being trans. We also interpret our findings in the context of the gender minority stress model. While our small sample was fairly homogenous in terms of age, race/ethnicity, geography, and social context, our findings indicate the need to create space for gender euphoria within gender-affirming medical systems and to conduct further research.

## Dysphoria and transnormativity 

Most research on trans experiences centers around the concept of gender dysphoria, which the 5th edition of the American Psychiatric Association's *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5; 2013, s. 302.6) defines as "a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender" that is associated with "clinically significant distress or impairment." Similarly, the 7th edition of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health's *Standards of Care* (2012, 2) defines gender dysphoria as "discomfort or distress that is caused by a discrepancy between a person's gender identity and that person's sex assigned at birth (and the associated gender role and/or primary and secondary sex characteristics)." Accompanying gender dysphoria is a larger hegemonic narrative that dominates medical and mainstream cultural representations of trans identities. This narrative includes a sense of being "born in the wrong body," displaying gender non-conformity since childhood, and seeking medical transition to express an authentic inner self. Several scholars have referred to this narrative as *transnormativity.* Matte (2014) traces how interplay between trans activists and American medical and legal systems from 1960 to 1990 produced these narratives as a way to gain legitimacy and recognition of trans identities in the public eye. Johnson (2016) further defines transnormativity by focusing on how trans people are held accountable to these narratives. Both scholars argue that while transnormativity has been used successfully to gain some trans people rights and legitimacy in the public eye, it has also constrained the narratives available to trans people.

Both historically and in the present day, trans people seeking gender-affirming medical care have often felt the need to selectively narrate their experiences in a way that is legible to care providers operating in a medial model. This has often meant emphasizing dysphoria and distress over other aspects of experiences of gender (Bolin 1988; Davy 2015; Johnson 2015; shuster 2021). This pervasive focus on distress has detrimental impacts on the lives of trans people. Budge, Orovecz, and Thai (2015, 422) argue that the overwhelming emphasis on dysphoria and distress in trans narratives "fuels anxiety and anticipatory negative emotional processes" for trans people and limits their ability to experience and express positive emotions. Relatedly, Westbrook (2021) describes how activists working to raise awareness about violence against trans people through campaigns such as Transgender Day of Remembrance have argued for the protection of trans lives primarily by focusing on the unjust violence they face, and in the process have constructed trans lives as inherently vulnerable and victimized. An unintended consequence of this strategy is an increase in feelings of fear and hopelessness among trans people, who see themselves as in constant threat of violence. To position trans lives as worth living, Westbrook (2021, 175) argues that we must not only focus on the violence trans people face, but also the joyful lives they live: "narratives about transgender lives should highlight gender euphoria, not just dysphoria, as well as transgender joy, not just risk for violence." Westbrook and Budge, Orovecz, and Thai's research demonstrate how transnormativity---and in particular, the overemphasis on trans distress and dysphoria---restricts the emotional expression of trans people.

## Gender minority stress model 

The sexual minority stress model, first developed by Brooks in her work with lesbian women in 1981 and popularized by Meyer in 1995, describes how homophobia and oppression impact sexual minority people's health and well-being. In recent years, Testa and colleagues (Hendricks and Testa 2012; Testa et al. 2015) have applied this model to trans people using the gender minority stress model. This model distinguishes between distal or external stressors, such as direct experiences of discrimination and violence, and proximal or internal stressors, such as internalized transphobia (Hendricks and Testa 2012; Testa et al. 2015). The impact of these stressors is mediated by resilience factors, including community connectedness and pride (Testa et al. 2015). Recently, some scholars have proposed gender dysphoria as an additional proximal stressor that may be worsened or alleviated by distal stressors and other social experiences (Cooper et al. 2020; Galupo, Pulice-Farrow, and Lindley 2020; Lindley and Galupo 2020).

Related work has also considered the importance of gender affirmation to trans people's health and well-being. For example, Sevelius (2013) uses gender affirmation as a framework for understanding risky behavior among trans women of colour. Sevelius posits that transphobic stigma leads to both psychological distress, which increases the need for gender affirmation, and social oppression, which decreases opportunities to access gender affirmation. This combines to create a state of identity threat, in which the need for gender affirmation exceeds the opportunities to access it. With few avenues to affirm their gender, the highly marginalized trans women of colour in Sevelius' research turned to activities such as sex work, substance use, and street hormone and injection silicone use, which meet their need for gender affirmation, but also increase their risk of HIV exposure. Other literature emphasizes the role of transition-related hormones and surgeries, gender-concordant identification, trans-affirming social support, and other gender-affirming experiences in improving the health and well-being of trans people (Baker et al. 2021; Bauer et al. 2015; Bradford, Rider, and Spencer 2019; Glynn et al. 2016; Hughto et al. 2020; Lelutiu-Weinberger, English, and Sandanapitchai 2020; Matsuno and Israel 2018; Scheim, Perez-Brumer, and Bauer 2020). Finally, Budge and colleagues' (Budge et al. 2013; Budge, Chin, and Minero 2017; Budge, Orovecz, and Thai 2015) qualitative research on trans people's emotions and coping strategies highlight how positive emotions and experiences can help trans people cope with dysphoria, distress, and discrimination.

Thus, while existing literature demonstrates that gender affirmation plays an important role in trans people's health and well-being, further research is needed to understand these processes in more detail. One phenomenon that may play an important role is gender euphoria.

## Gender euphoria

The term gender euphoria has been used in trans communities since at least 1976, when it was used to describe people who "\[felt\] content expressing a dual gender role," in contrast to "transsexuals" who experienced dysphoria and sought medical transition (Kane 1976, 5--6). A decade later, the term appeared in the title of the newsletter of the Boulton and Park Society, a transgender peer support group based in San Antonio, Texas that was active from 1986 to 1999 (Digital Transgender Archive n.d.). The term is also mentioned in Devor's (2004, 63) model of trans identity development, where he explains that as trans people transition into their affirmed gender, "many people find that their feelings of gender dysphoria are supplanted by feelings of gender euphoria." In recent years, the term has become increasingly popular among trans communities to describe positive gender-related feelings, in contrast with gender dysphoria.

Beischel, Gauvin, and van Anders (2021) provide the first research-based effort to define and explain gender euphoria through an online survey in which they recruited 47 participants who were familiar with the term gender euphoria. Most participants identified as trans or nonbinary, but a substantial minority were cisgender. Based on their findings, Beischel, Gauvin, and van Anders (2021, 13) define euphoria as a "joyful feeling of rightness" related to gender. Austin, Papciak, and Lovins' (2022) research using photo elicitation interviews confirmed and extended Beischel, Gauvin, and van Anders' findings. They found that euphoria describes "a constellation of emotional reactions" that can vary greatly in terms of intensity, duration, and specific emotions (Austin, Papciak, and Lovins 2022, 16).

Aside from the articles mentioned above, gender euphoria is mentioned in a handful of academic articles. Ashley and Ells (2018, 24) define gender euphoria as "the positive homologue of gender dysphoria," referring to "a distinct enjoyment or satisfaction caused by the correspondence between the person's gender identity and gendered features associated with a gender other than the one assigned at birth." Bradford, Rider, and Spencer (2019, 6) have proposed that "gender euphoria can be understood in terms of increased subjective well-being, including greater positive affect and decreased negative affect, in relation to gender transition and gender-affirmative interventions." While broad in scope, both definitions emphasize that euphoria refers to positive gender-related emotions.

While academic literature on the topic is scant, several trans community members have written on the topic in non-academic books, blogs, and other formats. This includes Kane's work in the *Provincetown Symposium,* quoted above. Additionally, Iantaffi and Barker (2017, 128) describe euphoria in their book *How to Understand Your Gender* as "moments of pure joy, when you feel good about your body, how you feel in it, what you\'re wearing, and how you\'re perceived by others". In *The A--Z of Gender and Sexuality*, Holleb (2019, 132) defines gender euphoria as "the trans joy of experiencing your gender. Gender euphoria is a sense of joy, exhilaration, and excitement experienced when you feel happy with your gender or gender expression." Hawley (2019, paras. 5--6), author of the blog "Trans Autistic Feminist," describes her experience of euphoria as "a deep feeling of happiness that overcomes me" and as "an affirmation that transitioning was the right thing for me." These three definitions encapsulate a range of experiences that may be understood as gender euphoria, and all revolve around a sense of joy, happiness, and affirmation.

As Iantaffi and Barker's definition suggests, euphoria can be derived from a variety of experiences, including an internal feeling of contentment with one's body or from external social interactions. Beischel, Gauvin, and van Anders (2021) found that their participants described euphoria as arising from both internal and external triggers related to their physical body, social experiences, and/or self-concept and identity. Similarly, Austin, Papciak, and Lovins (2022) highlighted the importance of "gender-affirming antecedents" in preceding feelings of euphoria. These antecedents included medical transition as well as non-medical aspects of gender expression and transition. Notably, the authors found that specific thoughts and self-talk often contributed to experiences of euphoria, highlighting that "it is not simply the gender affirming interventions and experiences, but also meanings ascribed to them by the individuals that leads to feelings of gender euphoria" (Austin, Papciak, and Lovins 2022, 12).

In sum, the literature suggests that gender euphoria is an important aspect of trans identity and experiences for some individuals, but little is understood about the different manifestations euphoria may take, who experiences it, and how it may change over time or in different contexts. This research sought to fill this gap by using in-depth qualitative interviews with trans individuals to understand their experiences of euphoria and contribute to developing a theoretical definition and conceptualization of the term.

## Methods

This research used qualitative interviews and a grounded theory approach to understand how some trans individuals describe, articulate, and label their experiences of gender euphoria. Grounded theory is an inductive approach to research that seeks to make meaning out of the data and then abstract to the level of theory, rather than imposing a pre-existing framework or hypothesis. The research protocol was approved by the University of Victoria's human research ethics board.

Participant selection was guided by a combination of theoretical and convenience sampling. To be eligible, all participants had to identify as trans; have taken some steps towards transitioning, whatever that meant to them; and be between the ages of 19 and 29. These criteria were chosen for several reasons. As this study focused specifically on defining trans experiences, it would be unethical and counter to the aims of this research to impose the term on individuals who may not identify with the term. However, we understand trans in an expansive and inclusive manner, recognizing that individuals with specific identities of transgender, transsexual, nonbinary, Two-Spirit, genderqueer, agender, and other identities may identify as trans. Given the varied and contested meanings of trans, we chose to allow participants to interpret the term themselves when deciding to participate.

The existing literature suggests that people tend to experience gender euphoria more after beginning to transition than before (see Austin, Papciak, and Lovins 2022; Beischel, Gauvin, and Anders 2021; Bradford, Rider, and Spencer 2019; Glynn et al. 2016), and as such, it is useful for participants to have had experiences that are likely to result in gender euphoria, rather than anticipating transition while being unable to access it. We understand transition as a non-linear journey that may include---but is not limited to---changes in gender expression, name and pronoun usage, gender roles, and gender-affirming medical interventions. Participants were accepted into the study based on their own assertion that they had taken some steps towards transition---whatever that meant for them.

Finally, the third criterion related to age was chosen for convenience. Given that the primary researcher is a trans and nonbinary person in their early 20s and many of their trans networks are in a similar age range, they are best positioned as a peer to other young trans individuals. As trans communities have historically been researched by cisgender individuals who do not share the participants' experiences of gender, the researcher's insider positionality in terms of trans identity and age was important to building trust and rapport with participants and collecting rich data. The age criteria for participants was therefore established as 19--29, with the lower limit chosen to reflect the age of majority where the research was conducted.

In addition, race and gender identity were expected to be salient characteristics, and as such we sought to reflect the diversity of identities and individuals within the trans community to the extent possible given the small sample size. Therefore, we planned to interview a minimum of one transmasculine-identified individual, one transfeminine-identified individual, and one person of colour. Due to time limitations and capacity constraints for this exploratory study, the maximum number of participants was set at six individuals before recruitment began. To be considered as a potential participant, individuals were asked to provide their name, age, the words they use to describe their gender, and whether they identified as BIPOC/a person of colour/a racialized person. This information was used to determine eligibility. As more than 30 individuals responded to the call for participants, participants were selected largely according to the order in which emails were received, with some flexibility to ensure sampling quotas related to gender and race were reached. Specifically, a few white potential participants were placed on a waitlist to prioritize racialized participants. Overall, interviews with six individuals were scheduled, but the sixth participant did not show up, resulting in a final sample of five individuals. Demographic information of the final sample of five participants along with the pseudonym chosen by each participant is found in Table 1.

All recruitment was conducted online through LGBTQI+ Facebook groups based in British Columbia (BC), Canada. While living in BC was not a requirement, all participants lived in BC at the time of their interview. The study was advertised as a "Gender Euphoria Research Study" and described as "a trans-led research project on trans people's experiences of euphoria, joy, happiness and affirmation related to their gender." Data collection took the form of semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted and recorded over Zoom in January 2020. Interviews ranged in length from 40 to 60 minutes. The first author conducted all interviews, and established rapport and trust with participants before recording began by describing the research project and its goals; sharing relevant aspects of their identity as a young, white, neurodivergent, trans, nonbinary, and queer person; and reviewing the informed consent document that had previously been shared with the participant. After the participant confirmed their consent, the first author followed a semi-structured interview guide which began by asking participants to recall times they had experienced happiness, joy, affirmation, pleasure, contentment, or euphoria in relation to their gender. The interviewer probed for details about what prompted the emotions, what they felt like, and other details about the experience. Participants were also asked broader questions about the language they used to describe these feelings, whether and how these experiences were important to their identity and transition journey, how they felt euphoria related to dysphoria, and what they would like other people to know about their experiences with euphoria.

Guided by a grounded theory approach (Charmaz 2006), the first author conducted inductive emergent coding of the interview transcripts using NVIVO 12. Using the codes generated by this process, they collapsed and clarified categories to create a preliminary codebook. This codebook was then used for repeated rounds of coding until all interviews had been coded multiple times using a consistent codebook. Based on this codebook, the first author then created a list of key themes and collected key quotes and insights related to each theme, which formed the basis of the findings section. When a first draft of the manuscript was complete, the first author provided a copy of the manuscript to all participants for their feedback and to confirm quotes used. Four of the five participants responded, all with positive feedback, and one with a minor correction. The second author provided feedback and input throughout all stages of the research process.

At the time of research design and data collection, there were no published studies on gender euphoria. As such, this research was designed as a small, exploratory pilot study. The results provide a case study in the experiences of gender euphoria for five young, mostly white, trans people in BC, Canada, and do not represent all experiences of gender euphoria. Rather, the study results provide a preliminary description of gender euphoria and indicate some directions for future research.

## Findings

### Defining euphoria

Participants defined euphoria in a variety of terms. Pike defined it as simply "acceptance" and Loaf described it as "confidence \[and\] self-happiness about your body." Higgs described euphoria as "a wonderful explosion," while Jake explained it as a "feeling of joy that radiates throughout my entire body, that either confirms how I might be feeling or validates who I am." Finally, Curtis defined euphoria as "positivity ... \[that\] makes the brain stop in the best way possible." Given this range of experiences, emotions, and sensations held by participants under the umbrella of gender euphoria, we confirm previous definitions of euphoria as positive emotions resulting from affirmation of one's gender identity or expression.

### Intensity and frequency

Participants described euphoria as a complex, multi-faceted emotion that could take many different forms. In particular, they all distinguished between two types of euphoria: firstly, an ecstatic joy which at times felt explosive or overwhelming, and often occurred at milestones in their gender journey, and secondly, a quiet sense of calmness and relief that tended to occur once participants were being gendered correctly more frequently. This first feeling was described as energy, "joy," "a surge of happiness," and "confidence" that at times felt "powerful," "explosive," or "overwhelming." Participants likened the feeling to that of fizziness, a "spark," or "fireworks," and often identified the emotion as beginning in their chest and spreading to other parts of their body. In contrast, the second feeling was a quieter, less noticeable feeling that felt like "relief," calmness, peace, "soundness," wholeness, "resonance," "acceptance," and authenticity. Jake, Curtis, Higgs, and Pike, who had all been transitioning for at least five years, noted that the explosive joy moments were more common early on in their transition, while the quieter feelings were more common after they had been out for several years. Experiences that might have brought them euphoria earlier on, such as being gendered correctly, were now much more commonplace and did not elicit the same intensity of emotions. Jake, who had been medically transitioning for 6 years and socially transitioning for longer, explained:

> I think in the beginning there would have been a lot of new moments---or even before coming out, exploring my gender, all of that would have been new, so then I probably would have experienced euphoria a lot more frequently. And now it's a little bit more calm and peaceful.

Two participants, Curtis and Jake, referred to this second, quieter type of euphoria as *affirmation*, and reserved the term *euphoria* for more explosive and significant moments of joy. Another participant, Higgs, associated affirmation with clinical settings and language, as in "gender-affirmation surgery," and preferred to use euphoria to refer to both types of feelings. While participants varied in their use of terminology, all five distinguished between these two types of euphoria based on their intensity and frequency.

### Prompting events

Participants described euphoria as arising from many different prompting events and experiences. Those who had embarked on medical transition by way of hormone replacement therapy or gender-affirming surgeries---Higgs, Curtis, Jake, and Pike---described the resulting physical and emotional changes as euphoric. The physical changes brought their gender expression and others' perceptions of their gender more in line with their internal gender identity, resulting in euphoria. Even before any visible changes had occurred, however, participants identified the knowledge that changes would soon occur as empowering. Curtis explained: "Just being able to say that I\'m on T \[testosterone\] made me feel like I'm in progress. It's like a little loading bar and it's finally moving." Both Curtis and Jake described the day of their first testosterone injection as ecstatic and energetic, sometimes to the point of being overwhelming. This explosion of energy and emotion was the ultimate peak of euphoria for them. For Higgs, the increased range and intensity of emotions that taking estrogen brought about was euphoric. They explained it affirmed their sense of themselves as a woman and "an estrogen-powered individual": "It feels like my brain is working how it's always supposed to be working, or how I've always wanted to be." These internal changes affirmed her gender identity, even when they weren't visible to others.

All participants also identified non-medical practices that resulted in physical changes to their appearance as affirming and euphoric, such as exercising, buying new clothing, and wearing a binder to flatten their chest. Pike and Higgs particularly enjoyed the self-determination in choosing how to express their gender and modify their body. For example, Higgs explained why she liked working out: "Especially pre-HRT ... working out was a way I could modify my body in ways that are more traditionally feminine and stuff like that, and it was a way of gaining control." Higgs identified both the physical changes resulting from working out and the practice of exercising itself as euphoric, as they expressed their gender in ways that reflected and affirmed their internal sense of themselves. Similarly, Pike remembered the sense of freedom and euphoria they felt when they tried on a binder for the first time:

> I remember just going in the mirror and just staring for a second, and turning to the side and just seeing that flatness and just being like, I can do whatever I want! Gender is fake! The world is my oyster! I can do what I want! \[laughing\]

Both Higgs and Pike identified feeling empowered to express their gender in the ways that they wanted as euphoric.

In addition to the experience of internal empowerment, Curtis and Pike reported that they were gendered correctly more of the time once they began transitioning, which resulted in more moments of gender euphoria. Curtis explained: "once I got facial hair, nobody misgendered me, like it was just this immediate camouflage mask of like alright, you're a dude, fine, we can't fight you on it anymore." Loaf contrasted the dysphoria of being misgendered with the affirmation of being gendered correctly: "when someone uses she/her, it just \[shudders\], it feels like sandpaper against the skin, it feels like a whip against the back. But when someone uses they/them, it just feels right." All participants identified being gendered correctly by others as affirming and/or euphoric, whether through the use of pronouns, compliments, honorifics and titles, or their chosen name.

For participants who identified as nonbinary or genderfluid, expressing the contradictions and instabilities within their gender sometimes elicited euphoria. Pike described their most significant moment of euphoria that occurred at a pride parade, where they were wearing a lacy bra and feminine shorts alongside a full beard and thick body hair: "It was very affirming for me and it was very much like, I can be in this strange in-between space and still feel safe with myself." Similarly, Higgs enjoyed combining different gender norms and expressions, such as their long hair and acrylic nails with their deep voice. She described this as "thumbing your nose at gender," explaining that having the freedom to express her gender outside of the binary was key to developing the sense of authenticity and self-determination that led to euphoria.

Four participants also identified sexuality as a site of gender euphoria for them. Exploring and expressing their gender identity paralleled an increasing sense of freedom from heteronormative sexual scripts. Higgs explained:

> So I think what's also great about queer sex is the lack of script. You can make up anything and it's wholly focused on pleasure and communication ... and being like "I like this, I do not like this. Call me this, do not call me this. I have these parts that I like to use in these ways, and other parts I like to pretend do not exist at all."

Higgs expressed her gender by re-defining what sex looked like for her and by choosing the words she used to describe her genitalia and body parts. She noted that she experienced this affirmation and euphoria when dating both cis and trans women, but that it came more naturally when with other trans people. She explained that she would sometimes feel burdened by the need to explain her body and gender in detail to cis women who lacked a shared experience, whereas with other trans people, there was "such a degree of understanding and acceptance and patience." Similarly, Jake found hooking up with other trans people euphoric, as he was able see parts of himself in the trans men he dated and experienced increased acceptance and love for both their bodies and his own. He described one particular moment:

> I remember after top surgery, my scars were really prominent, and I was feeling really unsure about the way that my nipples looked as well. And then I hooked up with this trans guy, and just seeing his scars and seeing the way he looked, I was like, "Oh, I don\'t have to feel bad about my body because I know that they \[the scars\] look as beautiful as his do."

By finding other trans men's bodies attractive, Jake was able to learn to find himself attractive as well.

Higgs found that dating trans people with different bodies and genders also elicited euphoria, as they could play with gender roles and expectations in a way that was mutually affirming and satisfying. She described using roleplay and sex toys to play with gendered sexual scripts and giving gendered compliments like "my big strong man" and "you're so small and feminine" to affirm her partner's gender, even when the compliments defied the reality of their bodies. Loaf found similar euphoria in their relationship with a cis man, explaining that their partner supported them in "finding a new way to enjoy \[their\] body" during sex such as by "using ... a clitoris stroker instead of using an insertable toy."

Curtis, Pike, Loaf and Higgs also described finding gender euphoria through the internet and media representations, such as by choosing their character's gender in video games or seeing trans characters in books and television shows. For example, Higgs found euphoria in playing the character Samus in Super Smash Bros., an extremely muscular and tall woman: "She's badass, she's strong, her moves fucking hit like a tank, she's awesome. She's what I want to be." As video games had been a place where Higgs dissociated from her reality before she transitioned, by playing as woman and seeing her gender represented in the fantasy world into which she escaped, Higgs was able to bridge the divide between her real life and physical body and the video games she used as an escape.

Curtis and Pike described interacting anonymously on the internet while growing up as an early way to explore their gender identities and experience euphoria. Curtis explained: "I could just identify as male, and nobody questioned it, nobody asked. I didn't have a chest, I didn't have a voice, I was just a person behind a screen. And I could just be Curtis." Pike explained that they found acceptance in the furry community online, a subculture where individuals represent themselves as anthropomorphic animal characters, often associated with the queer community and sometimes including sexual imagery. They explained:

> Your fursona could look like whatever you wanted ... And so it was this really good sense of freedom and having that ability to completely be like, do I feel comfortable like this? Is this aesthetically pleasing for me? Is this the kind of validation that I want? That was very euphoric for me and very validating for me.

By interacting behind the safety of a screen, Curtis and Pike were able to express their gender at times when they couldn't do so in their offline lives.

Loaf found that seeing other trans characters in the media who used they/them pronouns affirmed their gender, helping them feel "that I'm not weird, that I'm not a freak." Pike also identified media representations of other trans people as key to their euphoria. In particular, they resonated with the character Jess from *Stone Butch Blues* by Leslie Feinberg (1993). Pike explained:

> It was this literal written document of, here you are, of this is everything you've ever lived in this book that was written by someone thousands of miles away feeling the same things that you are. And it was just huge for me.

Whether through using video games and fursonas to express and explore their gender or by seeing themselves represented in another trans character, Higgs, Pike, Loaf, and Curtis all identified the internet and media representations as sites of euphoria, particularly when they couldn't experience euphoria in offline settings.

Curtis, Higgs, and Pike described their euphoria as reliant on experiencing affirmations from other people and being recognized as their true gender. For example, Higgs found euphoria in being treated as just another girl when hanging out with other women: "women accepting me and talking to me like they talk to other women ... stuff they wouldn't normally or typically tell their guy friends." Similarly, Pike found validation in being treated by cisgender men as a fellow man, especially after they disclosed their trans identity. They described one moment after coming out to a co-worker as trans:

> He was able to give me---like as a cis guy---that same level of acceptance I felt going to my trans spaces. And that acceptance\... it was euphoric in a way of just like, number one, there's still good dudes out there that I can trust. Number two, guys like that see me as part of their circle too.

Pike had grown up in a rural area with few role models of positive masculinity, and so claiming their own masculinity and membership as a man through interactions with other men was an important and euphoric experience for them.

### Changes in euphoria and dysphoria over time

In general, participants described their euphoria as increasing over time, as they were able to transition, access gender-affirming medical care, and express their gender in the ways that they wanted. They were affirmed in their gender by others more of the time, and therefore experienced more euphoria. But as the frequency of these euphoric experiences increased, the accompanying emotions also changed. Jake explained that in the early stages of his transition, he was experiencing many moments for the first time accompanied by intense euphoria. Now that he had been out as trans for five years, he experienced more feelings of calmness and peace---what he called affirmation---and less excitement and euphoria. When asked to describe times they had experienced euphoria, all five participants mentioned important "firsts" in their transitions, such as their first day on hormones, first time going out shirtless after top surgery, or first time introducing themselves with their chosen name and pronouns. As these experiences became more frequent and a regular part of their lives, Curtis, Higgs, Jake, and Pike explained that affirming moments become more commonplace and less exciting. This allowed them to experience an increased sense of safety, comfort, and security in their daily lives, which participants described as being foundational to their mental health and well-being. For example, Curtis noted that his mood was more stable and less affected by others' perceptions of him as he progressed in his transition. Higgs also found that as they felt more confident and secure in their gender, they didn't feel the need to put as much work into "performing the rituals of femininity" in order to be gendered correctly and were able to choose to present more androgynously or masculinely without threatening their emotional or physical safety. But these changes in the intensity and arousal level of gender-related emotions also came with drawbacks---what Pike called "the gentle curse of having it become normal." Curtis, Higgs, and Jake expressed similar sentiments, explaining that as they now took affirming experiences like being gendered correctly for granted, they had to actively seek out new experiences to feel intense euphoria again.

Curtis, Loaf, and Pike defined euphoria by relating it to dysphoria. For example, Curtis defined euphoria as the opposite of dysphoria, and added that most of the time for him, his euphoria was simply the lack of dysphoria. Loaf agreed that euphoria and dysphoria were opposites, but added that both could be experienced simultaneously, explaining that "gender euphoria and dysphoria is kind of like a binary, like a 1 or a 0 and then there's values in between." Pike also conceptualized euphoria and dysphoria as two distinct but related phenomena that could be experienced at the same time:

> I see life as this subject of graphs. So you can have a lot of dysphoria and euphoria at the same time, depending on your environmental outputs and inputs for yourself.

Pike illustrated this by explaining that while they had a close circle of queer friends that affirmed their gender and brought them euphoria, they also experienced isolation, ostracization, and dysphoria in their workplace. Pike's experience demonstrates that while levels of euphoria and dysphoria may change over time, it is important not to assume this means a linear progression away from dysphoria and towards euphoria.

### The importance of euphoria

While dysphoria is typically seen as the defining feature of trans experiences, three participants identified euphoria as more important than dysphoria to their gender journeys. While dysphoria was distressing and confusing, euphoria elicited clarity and understanding. Loaf succinctly summed it up: "Dysphoria really doesn't help; it just causes confusion and anguish. Euphoria guides and points to where you want to go on your journey." Jake concurred and elaborated, noting that:

> I know that trans identity is so defined by this feeling of dysphoria, but you know, I don\'t think we would put ourselves through so much difficulty to come out and to change the way we look and change the way we interact with other people if there wasn't something pleasurable about that.

Higgs expressed a similar sentiment, noting that:

> Euphoria tends to be the rule instead of the exception. Like the exception is the bad hard things that are part of transness, and most of the time, 99% of the time, I am so elated and happy to be trans and nonbinary. And I think that's the rule for most trans people I talk to, at any stage. Like the early stages are pretty rough because self-discovery is rough, but there's always this undercurrent of joy and love and self-love and love of others that is fundamental to what being trans is for me and for a lot of people that I talk to. And I don't think people get that.

Both Higgs and Jake were careful not to minimize the negative impact that dysphoria can have on trans people's mental health and well-being. However, Higgs, Jake, and Loaf felt that it was more important to recognize euphoria, as this challenged normative ideas of transness and better reflected their own experiences.

### Euphoria and mental health

Each participant described their experiences of euphoria and dysphoria as inextricably linked to their general mental health and well-being. Lessening dysphoria tended to improve the rest of their mental health, just as taking care of their mental health helped lessen their dysphoria, but their mental health also impacted their ability to experience euphoria in the first place. For example, Pike explained that when they were depressed, they tended to isolate themselves, spending less time with supportive individuals who might affirm their gender, and therefore experienced euphoria less often. They also struggled with social anxiety and noted that this was compounded by hypervigilance of other people's perceptions of their gender and feeling that their gender was a burden or disappointment for other people. They explained:

> I have a feeling that's why I withdraw from people a lot, is because there's no mask to put on \[when alone\]. That's where my euphoria is, and then being in social situations ... is really stressful for me.

Pike would cope with this anxiety by retreating from other people and spending time alone, but this had the negative effect of limiting their opportunities to experience social affirmation and therefore euphoria.

Curtis also struggled with depression and explained that he found it difficult to take care of himself before he started testosterone due to the overwhelming dysphoria he was experiencing:

> If I feel like garbage and I feel like my body is going the other way or I'm just not loving myself, my brain---and it's definitely not intentional---but my brain almost punishes my body. I shower less, I eat worse, I don't get out.

But as his body changed and he experienced less physical dysphoria, Curtis was able to show himself more kindness and care, practices that helped elicit euphoria.

Loaf explained that the intensity and frequency of moments of euphoria also depended on their mental health at that time: "If my mental health is good, it lasts longer. It can last the entire day. But if my mental health is not good, it could be very fleeting, or I could even possibly interpret it as patronizing." Participants' other experiences with mental illness and neurodivergence informed their perceptions of euphoria and dysphoria. For example, Higgs and Jake identified as substance users and used the intoxicating and energetic effects of some drugs as an analogy for euphoria. Higgs explained

> It's like the chasing the dragon kind of high, where at the beginning, you just need a tiny little hit of weed, and you're high ... and now painting my nails is such a base thing where I feel weird without it.

Here, Higgs compares the idea of tolerance to a drug's effects to a baseline level of euphoria, where small acts like painting her nails that once brought her intense euphoria were now part of her every day and less significant. For both Higgs and Jake, their experiences with substance use affected the way they framed and talked about their experiences of euphoria.

Curtis, who is on the autism spectrum, explained that his autism affected how he expressed and reacted to moments of euphoria. He described the day he started testosterone: "Oh, I was ticcing ... the hands just, you know, started going, shaking \[gestures flapping hands\]. My back teeth are grinding in the best way possible. I'm ready to lift off the ground." His neurodivergence interacted with his experiences of euphoria such that he expressed his feelings with full-body movements, described as stimming or ticcing within the autistic community.

Loaf, who had experienced past relationship abuse and grooming, found that their journey to accepting their gender paralleled their process of healing from abuse. The first few times they experienced gender euphoria, they found themselves trying to suppress their feelings, as they had become used to prioritizing other's needs and wants above their own. But they explained that "The more that I got away from my abusive ex-partner, the more I became comfortable with it \[gender euphoria\] ... so in the process of cutting off this person, I became more and more accepting of my actual identity." As they distanced themselves from their abuser and healed from their trauma, Loaf was able to experience euphoria and self-acceptance more frequently.

Jake, who had experienced body dysmorphia and disordered eating since the age of 13, explained that his body dysmorphia lessened along with his dysphoria: "It's definitely gotten easier to manage now that I'm happier with more aspects of my body and the way that I'm perceived in the world." But transitioning did not completely solve his dysmorphia, as he noted that

> after top surgery, my stomach has, you know, when I look down, I can see it more prominently, and when I wear clothing that's what the bump is instead of my chest. So I still struggle with some fatphobia and I think dysmorphia is there as well.

Every participant also identified euphoria as a resource and coping strategy they could draw upon to help get through dysphoric and difficult periods. For example, Loaf explained that wearing a binder to flatten their chest lessened their dysphoria and improved their mood. Curtis described testosterone as his "magic juice," explaining that "I could handle anything as soon as I was on T. Someone could misgender me, because then my mind goes, 'not for long.'" Similarly, Higgs described drawing on her own internal resilience and sense of self-determination to cope with being misgendered and other microaggressions. These experiences suggest that experiencing euphoria can improve an individual's self-esteem, self-acceptance, and confidence in their gender, along with fostering resilience and providing a resource to draw on to cope with the inevitable moments of dysphoria and transphobia. Participant's description of the relationship between euphoria, dysphoria, and other aspects of their mental health demonstrates that gender-related emotions can be embedded in the individual's larger psychosocial contexts and affected by other aspects of their life and well-being.

### Importance of trans community

Each of the five participants identified spending time with other trans people and in LGBTQI+ community spaces as a key aspect of what brought them euphoria. When with other trans people, participants didn't have to explain themselves as much, and experienced the euphoria of connection and recognition of oneself in others. Jake explained: "Finally talking to people who saw me the way that I wanted to be seen and validated, that feels good." When so much of participant's lives were spent around people who did not affirm their gender, spending time around people who not only affirmed but could relate to their experiences was euphoric. For example, Jake recalled getting his first binder with the help of a trans youth worker:

> I remember chatting with the guy, who was another trans guy. He was helping me find the right one, and just being seen and validated and like someone who saw me and wanted to help me get to the place where I wanted to be. Being cared for in that way made me really happy.

Similarly, Pike identified meeting someone who shared their gender identity for the first time as a deeply euphoric experience:

> Hearing from somebody who has the same gender identity as you, and you have the same sexuality kind of idea, it was like two leaves in the wind of the same very rare tree just happening to meet for a moment, and then going off in two different directions. And me and this person, I know we're going to be friends. We're going to keep in touch for a very long time, which I'm really grateful for. And it was this very validating experience of just not being alone.

Pike had struggled to find community around their butch identity, and so finding someone who shared their gender identity was very validating and affirming and created a connection that they identified as immediately bonding and emotionally intimate.

A few participants also noted that supporting and standing up for other trans people in their lives also validated themselves. Curtis explained: "Validating other people also kind of validates myself. It's like a two-way street. So being able to fight for them, makes me feel like I'm fighting for me." Similarly, Loaf explained that they supported their trans friends by validating their emotions and helping them identify what brought them euphoria. They found that doing so helped them experience euphoria themselves:

> I get gender euphoria helping other people out with their impostor syndrome and gender dysphoria. Because, it's funny, you can tell other trans and nonbinary people that what they're feeling is valid, and mean it, and say that their gender is valid, but when it comes to you, God forbid!

Even when Loaf was having a hard time showing kindness and compassion to themselves, by extending care to others they were able to begin to allow themselves to also accept that care and love.

### Impact of transnormativity and medicalization

While the interviews focused on positive emotions and experiences, every participant also brought up the impact of transphobic and transnormative narratives on their experiences of euphoria. For example, several participants identified as harmful the idea that a person must experience dysphoria to be trans. Loaf explained:

> There's a lot of internalized hatred and certain standards that you should meet if you're going to be considered nonbinary or trans. And even within the trans community, there's a lot of nonbinary hatred, because "You can only be one or the other! If you don't fit in, you're making the rest community look bad!" kind of thing.

Loaf and other participants found that these ideas contributed to self-doubt and had a negative impact on their mental health and self-esteem, including limiting their ability to experience euphoria. In particular, Loaf and Curtis discussed their experiences with impostor syndrome and questioning whether they were really trans. Loaf expressed that impostor syndrome presented itself in the form of an internal voice that questioned their identity and decision-making, hindering their efforts to seek out affirming and euphoric experiences. Similarly, Curtis felt that these normative expectations had limited his ability to experience euphoria, making it reliant on medical transition and passing as a cis man:

> So now as I've transitioned---and for me, it was mental health that has me put all of these high expectations on myself. And these like rigid binaries of when I'm allowed to feel euphoria. It's like I need to pass all these tests to like open a little box of happiness and if I don't, I don't get the box.

This demonstrates that even some binary-identifying trans people whose experiences largely resemble the "born in the wrong body" narrative may feel a negative impact of transnormativity on their euphoria.

All participants identified these harmful normative expectations as originating from both within and outside of the trans community. Curtis explained that many trans people internalize transphobic and cisnormative messages and reproduce them within the trans community--- "we make it into self-expectation as well, because we're socialized in a very rigid world." He elaborated that "I think sometimes we get so caught up in our oppression Olympics and our trauma Olympics of who suffered more, who is more trans ... that we don't even want to talk about the good stuff." Higgs, Jake, Loaf, and Pike also emphasized the role of medical gatekeeping and media stereotypes in creating and perpetuating harmful narratives about transness. Higgs identified the medical gatekeeping required to access gender-affirming care as perpetuating a deficit- and distress-based model of transness: "Medical model is something bad with you, therefore we'll fix it. Not something is missing in you and we're gonna help you fulfill that through an act of joy and love." They also highlighted the impact of media representations, noting that

> I have never seen a trans movie that is happy. Like not even just a little bit of happy. It's all supposed to be this terrible thing that destroys us, and I think that helps fit in the cis narrative of, "Well you're doing what they consider 'extreme measures' so there has to be extreme motivation for stuff like that." And the trope of the self-hating trans person is so persuasive and I think fundamentally wrong, because we don't do these things through an act of self-hate. Like, I didn't become a woman because I hated men and masculinity.

The media's emphasis on dysphoria, distress, and self-hatred did not reflect Higgs or her peers' experiences of being trans, and instead served to reinforce cis people's ideas of what it means to be trans. Specifically, Higgs identified that to justify medical transition---seen as "extreme" in the normative cisgender gaze---trans people needed to prove that they were experiencing "extreme" distress. But Higgs argued that this falsely associated transness with overwhelmingly negative experiences, ignoring the many joys and positive emotions she and other trans people experienced. Jake agreed, explaining that: "Being trans is a really pleasurable thing and a really enjoyable thing and that we wouldn't transition, we wouldn't come out if it wasn't pleasurable. And there is value in seeking that pleasure and expressing that pleasure." Jake felt that the overwhelming emphasis on trans people's high rates of mental illness and suicidality falsely blamed these experiences on being trans, rather than living in a transphobic society. All participants wanted the general public to better understand the possibilities of gender euphoria and other positive trans experiences, challenging the notion that being trans is an inherently negative experience.

This is not to say that participants did not experience dysphoria, mental illness, and other distressing and negative experiences. All participants experienced dysphoria to some degree, had struggled with mental illnesses, and described experiences of transphobia, rejection, and discrimination. But these were not the only, or even the most important, aspects of their trans identities or experiences. Curtis, the participant who emphasized his dysphoria the most, felt that dysphoria was more important than euphoria in defining his trans experience. He explained that dysphoria

> is a killer, you know, it kills people constantly. Maybe not physically, but it kills the soul. And I would much rather have them \[cis people\] understand why I need this and have the euphoria come from me than from them.

Here, Curtis recognizes the utility of the medical model's focus on dysphoria rather than euphoria, as dysphoria has the potential for significant harm and negative impacts that are important to attend to and can be alleviated through transition. However, Curtis also notes the limits of this model, noting that it is important to include stories of trans happiness and joy, and to highlight gender euphoria as a positive experience that he feels is unique to trans people.

Higgs and Jake explicitly identified the need for changes in gender-affirming medical practice to a model that better reflected their experiences and created space to discuss gender euphoria, not just dysphoria. Comparing it to the shift to strengths-based research in other areas of social science research, Higgs felt that medical care could improve by focusing more on resiliency and positive experiences---such as gender euphoria---as part of patient-centered care. Jake identified the informed consent model of accessing gender-affirming care as one possible way of changing medical models to incorporate gender euphoria. He elaborated:

> I think in the interviews \[for a readiness assessment\], rather than asking what I didn't like, if they were like, "What do you want and how can we help you achieve that through these medical interventions?", that would probably be a much more positive experience.

Both Jake and Higgs emphasized the importance of asking questions specifically about what patients wanted as outcomes of their transition and what made them feel good, which could create space for patients to talk about their experiences with gender euphoria. During his interview, Jake wondered aloud:

> I wonder how---because I know the medicalization of trans identity has been incredibly harmful and is a part of this colonial system that we live in---I wonder, though, how these narratives can change while still ensuring that we have access \[to gender-affirming care\].

Jake touches on an enduring dilemma of trans studies and gender-affirming health care: the need to meet trans people's immediate needs within a neoliberal capitalist system while also working to radically change that system. The process of finding that balance is complex and ongoing, but incorporating the language of gender euphoria into hormone and surgical readiness assessment offers one promising practice.

## Discussion

This research sought to understand how trans people describe experiences of positive emotions in relation to their gender, and to contribute to a definition and conceptualization of gender euphoria. We found that gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from affirmation of one's gender identity or expression and can include a wide variety of emotions and experiences. Experiences that may elicit euphoria include medical and social transition, social affirmation of one's gender, engaging in community care and solidarity with other trans people, and viewing media with positive trans representation. In line with the findings of Beischel, Gauvin, and van Anders (2021), participants described varying relationships between euphoria and dysphoria, but generally agreed that euphoria described positive emotions and dysphoria referenced negative emotions. Our participants emphasized the importance of euphoria and positive emotions in their experience of being trans and lamented the medical model and transnormative narratives' focus on distress and dysphoria.

Participants also highlighted the interconnected nature of euphoria, dysphoria, and mental health. These findings are consistent with the gender minority stress model, which argues that the impact of transphobia-related stressors is mediated by resilience factors, including community connectedness and pride (Testa et al. 2015). Our findings suggest that gender affirmation and euphoria may serve as additional resilience factors that moderate the impact of distal and proximal stressors on individuals' well-being and thereby may reduce dysphoria. Participants described drawing on moments of affirmation and euphoria as a resource to help them cope with dysphoria and distress. Further, participants explained that their euphoria was impacted by other stressors and mediating factors. For example, it was easier to experience euphoria when other resilience factors (community connectedness and pride) were high, and more difficult when experiencing high levels of hypervigilance in social situations (a proximal stressor) and misgendering (a distal stressor). This suggests that euphoria may moderate the impact of minority stressors on trans people's mental health, a hypothesis that is consistent with previous findings that social and medical transition and gender affirmation are associated with better mental health in trans populations (Glynn et al. 2016; Hughto et al. 2020; Lelutiu-Weinberger, English, and Sandanapitchai 2020).

Additionally, participants in this research described receiving microaffirmations from loved ones---such as providing emotional support and using gender-affirming language---as eliciting euphoria. Previous research on the various kinds of microaffirmations experienced by trans people in romantic relationships parallels our participants' descriptions of microaffirmations (Galupo et al. 2019; Pulice-Farrow, Bravo, and Galupo 2019). This provides evidence of the potential role of microaffirmations as a resilience factor in the minority stress model.

This research also demonstrates some of the limitations of the medical model of trans identity and some of the inaccuracies and harms that can come from deficit- and distress-based narratives of trans experiences. Participants repeatedly emphasized the harmful impact of hegemonic narratives of trans identities that focused on dysphoria and other negative emotions and experiences. This supports Johnson's (2016) finding that transnormativity functions as a hegemonic narrative that is enforced through external accountability to medical and sociolegal institutions, as well as internalized and reinforced within trans communities. Our participants argued that the medical model needs to shift focus from pain and dysphoria towards promoting joy and euphoria. They identified multiple means of enacting this change, from informed consent models of care to asking about gender euphoria in hormone and surgical readiness assessments. In fact, many were already implementing these practices within their everyday lives and communities. Loaf, for example, validated and empathized with their trans friends' emotions, and encouraged them to identify and seek out things that made them feel euphoric. Curtis was working on sharing more stories of positivity and hope within the trans community to counteract the emphasis on struggles and dysphoria. These examples highlight the importance of community connectedness and peer support and illuminate just some of the ways that trans people, and those who work with them, can help foster more joy and euphoria in trans lives.

Mental health professionals and peer support workers who work with trans clients can learn from these practices of care to help trans individuals experience more euphoria. Limited existing research provides examples of ways mental health professionals can support resilience and decrease distress for trans people. For example, Matsuno and Israel's (2018) transgender resilience intervention suggests that the impact of minority stressors on trans individuals can be reduced by developing resilience. This can be accomplished through group-level factors, such as social support, family acceptance, participating in trans communities and activism, and identifying positive role models, as well as individual factors, such as self-acceptance and hope. Matsuno and Israel suggest that therapists can support trans resilience by developing interventions that seek to increase these resilience factors in the lives of their clients.

Sloan, Berke, and Shipherd (2017) outline one such intervention that uses dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills to help trans individuals cope with dysphoria and distress. DBT posits that emotional dysregulation is the result of living in an emotionally invalidating environment. DBT then seeks to help clients develop coping and self-validation skills to reduce their emotional dysregulation. Applied to trans individuals, Sloan, Berke, and Shipherd argue that many trans people live in a constantly invalidating environment in which they may experience misgendering and microaggressions on regular basis, resulting in distress and dysphoria, as well as potentially maladaptive coping strategies. The authors outline how DBT skills can be used to cope with this dysphoria and distress and develop more adaptive coping tools. For example, using distress tolerance skills to manage dysphoria, seeking out affirming environments and experiences that reduce dysphoria using interpersonal effectiveness skills, and balancing the desire for future gender-related changes with acceptance of one's current reality using mindfulness and radical acceptance. Many of the strategies outlined by Sloan, Berke, and Shipherd could assist trans individuals in identifying what brings them euphoria and subsequently seeking it out.

Similarly, Austin, Papciak, and Lovins (2022) argue that given the importance participant's thoughts and emotions to their experiences of euphoria, therapy may be useful in helping decrease negative self-talk and thoughts about dysphoria and enhance experiences of euphoria. Finally, Withey-Rila et al. (2020) argue that social workers should prioritize pleasure in their assessments and interventions of trans people's sexualities and lives generally. Withey-Rila et al.'s call to prioritize pleasure in sexuality can be extended to prioritizing pleasure in life generally; to make transition not just about reducing dysphoria but about increasing euphoria and pursuing joy and comfort.

## Conclusion

This research sought to understand how trans people describe experiences of positive emotions in related to their gender, and specifically, to contribute to a definition and conceptualization of gender euphoria. We found that gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from affirmation of one's gender identity or expression and can include a wide variety of emotions and experiences. Our findings suggest that there may be different subtypes of gender euphoria based on the intensity and frequency of the emotions, and further research is needed to determine the best way to differentiate between these experiences.

We have also argued that gender affirmation and euphoria represent resilience factors that are consistent with the gender minority stress model. Specifically, euphoria may moderate the impact of proximal and distal stressors, such as transphobia and dysphoria, on trans people's mental health. Future research is needed to evaluate this proposal, including quantitative research to validate the concept of gender euphoria and its relationship to other concepts in the gender minority stress model. The Trans Youth CAN! Gender Positivity Scale is one validated measure that can be used to measure gender euphoria (Bauer et al. 2021)

Our findings underscore the potential for harms that can be created by the medical model's focus on dysphoria and distress in trans experiences. Instead, we emphasize the value of prioritizing supporting euphoria, happiness, and safety when asking about trans people's transition goals.

Finally, it is important to note the limitations of this research. These findings are based on a small sample of five individuals, who were relatively homogenous in terms of age, race, and geography. While we expected that race would be a salient characteristic that would impact participants' experiences of euphoria, race did not come up in any of the interviews. The interviewer positioned themselves as white at the start of interviews and did not specifically ask any participants about how their race interacted with their experience of gender. Further, as the interviewer positioned themselves as an insider to participants in terms of being a young trans person, participants may have been more likely to share experiences that they thought the interviewer would relate to, and less likely to discuss experiences for which the interviewer would have been an outsider, such as racialized experiences.

All five participants in this research had access to supportive trans communities, gender-affirming medical care, and a general level of social and economic privilege that allowed them to seek out and experience gender affirmation and euphoria. Individuals experiencing a greater burden of marginalization may not be able to access gender affirmation and euphoria to the same degree, and these experiences may look very different. As such, these findings cannot be generalized to trans and gender-diverse people generally, and future research on gender euphoria is needed with larger and more diverse samples.
