abstract: |
    In 2021, the United States experienced the most active year on record for anti-trans legislation. In 2022, we are witnessing the renewal of this legislative harassment, with increased success on the part of anti-trans lawmakers. When these bills are passed into law and, importantly, even when they are resoundingly defeated or fail to reach an actual vote, the harmful rhetoric and ideology that is attached to them reverberates throughout trans communities resulting in social and psychological harm for transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse people. The burden of addressing and offsetting this harm is often placed on the shoulders of other trans people who serve as grassroots leaders in their communities. This article argues that while this support is lifesaving for individual trans people, transformative change requires an increase in *structural competency* in our mainstream social institutions, and makes the case for applied trans studies as a pathway to that end.

- abstract: This chapter aims to analyze the sociabilities,
    information-sharing behaviors, and types of social support among
    users of French non-mixed trans Facebook groups. First, our national
    survey (N = 405) reveals that the different uses of these groups
    (information retrieval, emotional support, etc.) vary according to
    the age and education levels of their trans users, or according to
    their progress on the transition pathways. Second, we perform a
    lexical analysis of the messages (N = 70,488) posted, since 2013, in
    a sample of 24 groups, in order to identify the main topics of
    discussion. This analysis leads us to emphasize the diversity of
    social support provided by trans people to one another, via posts
    and comments. These findings deemphasize the benefits of
    institutional support because they suggest, alternatively, that
    trans people are organizing themselves to avoid challenges
    associated with medical institutions and the French "therapeutic
    shield.. Such individuals use Facebook to this end, sharing
    information or support in order to create a safe space managed with
    a transfeminist ethic, and allowing themselves to make
    gender-related choices more autonomously, far away from normative
    judgements (in particular those expressed by the medical
    profession).

- abstract: Objectives. We examined the independent demographic and
    psychosocial factors associated with psychological distress and
    resilience among transgender men and women.Methods. Our data came
    from an online survey involving a national Australian sample of 169
    transgender men and women in 2011. Survey questions assessed
    demographics; sources of support; contact with lesbian, gay,
    bisexual, and transgender peers; and experiences of victimization.
    We assessed the outcomes with the Kessler Psychological Distress
    Scale and the Brief Resilience Scale.Results. In all, 46.0% of the
    sample reported high or very high levels of psychological distress.
    Multivariable regression analyses identified considerably different
    independent factors for psychological distress and resilience.
    Younger age, feeling unable to turn to family for support, and
    victimization experiences were associated with greater psychological
    distress, whereas higher income, identifying as heterosexual, and
    having frequent contact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
    peers were associated with greater resilience.Conclusions. With
    different factors identified for psychological distress and
    resilience, these findings may help inform the development of
    tailored mental health interventions and resilience-building
    programs for this vulnerable population.

- abstract: This essay examines the stereotype that transgender people
    are "deceivers" and the stereotype's role in promoting and excusing
    transphobic violence. The stereotype derives from a contrast between
    gender presentation (appearance) and sexed body (concealed reality).
    Because gender presentation represents genital status, Bettcher
    argues, people who "misalign" the two are viewed as deceivers. The
    author shows how this system of gender presentation as genital
    representation is part of larger sexist and racist systems of
    violence and oppression.

- abstract: Objectives. We assessed the association between minority
    stress, mental health, and potential ameliorating factors in a
    large, community-based, geographically diverse sample of the US
    transgender population.Methods. In 2003, we recruited through the
    Internet a sample of 1093 male-to-female and female-to-male
    transgender persons, stratified by gender. Participants completed an
    online survey that included standardized measures of mental health.
    Guided by the minority stress model, we evaluated associations
    between stigma and mental health and tested whether indicators of
    resilience (family support, peer support, identity pride) moderated
    these associations.Results. Respondents had a high prevalence of
    clinical depression (44.1%), anxiety (33.2%), and somatization
    (27.5%). Social stigma was positively associated with psychological
    distress. Peer support (from other transgender people) moderated
    this relationship. We found few differences by gender
    identity.Conclusions. Our findings support the minority stress
    model. Prevention needs to confront social structures, norms, and
    attitudes that produce minority stress for gender-variant people;
    enhance peer support; and improve access to mental health and social
    services that affirm transgender identity and promote resilience.

- abstract: Objectives. We examined relationships between social
    determinants of health and experiences of transgender-related
    discrimination reported by transgender people in Virginia.Methods.
    In 2005 through 2006, 387 self-identified transgender people
    completed a statewide health needs assessment; 350 who completed
    eligibility questions were included in this examination of factors
    associated with experiences of discrimination in health care,
    employment, or housing. We fit multivariate logistic regression
    models using generalized estimating equations to adjust for survey
    modality (online vs paper).Results. Of participants, 41% (n = 143)
    reported experiences of transgender-related discrimination. Factors
    associated with transgender-related discrimination were geographic
    context, gender (female-to male spectrum vs male-to-female
    spectrum), low socioeconomic status, being a racial/ethnic minority,
    not having health insurance, gender transition indicators (younger
    age at first transgender awareness), health care needed but unable
    to be obtained (hormone therapy and mental health services), history
    of violence (sexual and physical), substance use health behaviors
    (tobacco and alcohol), and interpersonal factors (family support and
    community connectedness).Conclusions. Findings suggest that
    transgender Virginians experience widespread discrimination in
    health care, employment, and housing. Multilevel interventions are
    needed for transgender populations, including legal protections and
    training for health care providers.

- abstract: This study explored representation of lead and supporting
    transgender characters in nine U.S. scripted television dramas and
    comedies aired 2008--2014. Employing qualitative content analysis
    techniques, episodes were coded for casting, visibility, identity,
    embodiment, and social interaction. Findings suggested that scripted
    television has begun to evolve in a manner that relies less on a
    standardized narrative and one-dimensional characterization of
    transgender people. The formerly ubiquitous "wrong body" discourse
    seems to have ebbed in favor of more diverse and refined stories
    about transgender identity and subjectivity. However, increased
    visibility does not apply across the spectrum of transgender
    identity and expression. Transgender people as a population and a
    political community, trans men, and genderqueer characters remain
    largely invisible.

- abstract: "Trans students at New College of Florida provide
    overwhelmingly positive assessments of their campus culture as
    related to issues of gender identity, a stark contrast to existing
    literature on gender-nonconforming collegians. This chapter examines
    the interactional processes that create a context supportive of all
    genders -- the ways students are expected to act toward one another
    and how they hold each other accountable to these norms. I draw on
    interviews with 24 students with diverse identities to argue: (1)
    there is a trans-inclusive understanding of gender that is dominant
    on campus, (2) the students have norms that reflect the inclusive
    understanding and provide direction for when and how gender should
    enter interactions, and (3) swift responses to breaches of
    interactional norms serve to support gender-nonconforming students
    and affirm the identity of the community as unwilling to tolerate
    transphobia. This analysis demonstrates an alternative cultural
    context, one in which community members are held not to conventional
    expectations associated with assumed sex category, but to an
    understanding of gender that does not take identity for granted. In
    so doing, it highlights how shifts in shared understanding can
    create more inclusive interactional practices. Additionally, the
    focus on the meaning underlying social processes suggests that
    shifts in how people think about gender could similarly lead to
    alteration of organizational structures that would help trans
    students thrive."

- abstract: This article presents empirical research findings from a
    subsample of 290 transgender participants in the Virginia
    Transgender Health Initiative Survey (THIS) who reported whether or
    not they had experienced hostility or insensitivity related to their
    gender identity or expression during high school, termed in-school
    gender-based victimization (GBV). The purpose of this study was to
    assess the impact of in-school GBV on rates of suicide attempts
    among transgender people. Of the 290 respondents, 44.8% reported
    they had experienced in-school GBV, and 28.5% reported a history of
    suicide attempt. Among those who had attempted, 32.5% reported
    having made one attempt, 28.6% reported a history of two attempts,
    and 39.0% reported having made three or more attempts. Participants
    who reported experiencing GBV were approximately four times more
    likely to have attempted suicide than those who did not. Among the
    subgroups of 147 trans women and 81 trans men, GBV was associated
    both with history of suicide attempt, and with a higher number of
    suicide attempts over the life span. Implications for policy and
    clinical interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

- abstract: Background The impact of Minority Stress (MS) upon suicidal
    ideation and behaviours amongst Transgender and Gender
    Non-Conforming (TGNC) adults is not sufficiently understood, hence
    our intervention efforts on an individual and societal level are
    limited. This review aims to evaluate recent literature that reports
    on the association between MS and suicidal ideation and behaviours
    amongst TGNC adults. Methods PsycINFO, Web of Science, MEDLINE,
    CINAHL and EMBASE were systematically searched for relevant
    articles. Peer reviewed and grey literature were considered.
    Included papers reported quantitative analyses on associations
    between MS factors and suicidal ideation and behaviours amongst TGNC
    adults. The quality of papers was assessed. Results 28 papers were
    identified as eligible. Findings suggested positive associations
    between external and internal minority stressors and suicidal
    ideation and behaviour. Dysfunctional individual coping was
    associated with a greater likelihood of suicide attempts. Community
    resilience was negatively associated with suicidal outcomes, but did
    not consistently buffer the effects of minority stress. Limitations
    Overall quality of included papers was 'poor'. Almost all papers
    were cross-sectional by design, therefore causality cannot be
    inferred. Many papers measured variables using non-standardised
    measures undermining the reliability and validity of reported
    results. Conclusions Findings offer support to the application of MS
    theory to the understanding of suicidal ideation and behaviour
    amongst TGNC. Future research should use standardised measures and
    longitudinal designs to better support the investigation of
    directionality and causality. More research is needed to understand
    the complex interactions between minority stress factors and the
    role of resilience in this population.

- abstract: Purpose In this chapter, I assess the treatment of
    transgender within the sociology of gender and propose a new
    standard of transfeminist methodology that would work against
    transgender marginalization in social scientific research.
    Methodology/approach I assess the treatment of transgender within
    the sociology of gender by conducting a content analysis of all
    articles and chapters focusing on transgender people, experiences,
    bodies, and phenomena published between 1987 and 2014 in the journal
    Gender & Society (n = 12) and between 1996 and 2014 in the book
    series Advances in Gender Research (n = 5). Findings I first outline
    key tenets of feminist methodology and suggest additional
    transfeminist methodological considerations. I proceed to a content
    analysis of existing transgender research in two key publications to
    support my proposal of the development of transfeminist methodology.
    Originality/value This chapter highlights the need to expand
    feminist methodology for the study of transgender people and
    phenomena. Specifically, I propose the development of transfeminist
    methodology, an approach that centers on transgender experience and
    perspectives.

- abstract: "This article uses ethnographic methods to explore how peer
    support and community involvement influence the mental health and
    well-being of transgender (or, trans) people in the southeastern
    United States. The study builds on existing research that suggests
    that trans community involvement and peer support among trans people
    enhance mental health experiences and moderate the effects of stigma
    and discrimination on health outcomes. Through qualitative analysis
    of 158 hours of participant observation and 33 in-depth interviews
    with members of a trans community organization in the U.S.
    Southeast, this paper identifies three key processes through which
    peer support and community involvement enhance the mental health and
    well-being of trans people: (1) the normalization of trans
    identities and experiences; (2) the creation of a social support
    network; and (3) the empowerment of trans people."

- abstract: The status of transgender rights presents a national crisis,
    and organizational communication scholars must mobilize activist
    scholarship in which the "T" in "LGBT" (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
    transgender) matters in the argument presented and changes proposed.
    The purpose of this study was (a) to acknowledge transgender members
    as worthy of focused organizational study and (b) to theorize a
    transgender standpoint epistemology in an organizational
    context---an epistemology rooted in a standpoint marginalized at the
    societal level, within the LGBT community, and in communication
    scholarship. I discuss my collaboration with a community
    organization called Trans\*Spectrum, where I conducted 10 in-depth
    interviews with transgender employees. The study illustrates how
    gender identity, performativities, and presentation, as well as
    agency and privilege, coalesce within the bounds of organizational
    rules and norms to permit only certain bodies to navigate the
    workplace in particular, uniform ways. The results show how
    organizations could better curate spaces for acknowledgment,
    accommodation, and acceptance.

- abstract: Rationale There is a growing body of research involving
    transgender (trans) individuals that foregrounds elevated rates of
    suicidality in trans populations. Although peer support is
    increasingly studied as a protective factor against suicide among
    trans persons, the scholarship in this area continues to be limited
    and has yet to be synthesized and appraised. Objective In this
    paper, we address this existing gap in the literature by presenting
    the results of a scoping review of the literature examining the
    significance and function of peer support in mitigating suicide risk
    in trans populations. Methods This scoping review is based on an
    analysis of 34 studies that were included following the execution of
    a methodical search and selection process. Drawing on scoping review
    methodology, along with PRISMA-P guidelines, we selected
    peer-reviewed empirical works, published between 2000 and 2020,
    which examined relationships between providing, seeking, and/or
    receiving peer support and suicide risk in trans populations.
    Results Our findings, which are conceptualized using the minority
    stress model as a guiding theoretical framework, reveal that while
    the literature generally substantiates the protective significance
    of peer support for trans persons, a small body of work also
    uncovers novel and unanticipated sources of peer support, including
    social support offered by trans peers online, which are infrequently
    and inconsistently examined in this body of scholarship. Conclusions
    Using our appraisal of the literature, we outline the need for
    future research to further elucidate the significance and function
    of peer support in protecting against suicide among trans persons.
    In particular, we discuss the need for exploratory inquiry to inform
    a conceptualization and operationalization of peer support that more
    fully and consistently accounts for how such support (including
    online and community-based support) is sought, received, and
    experienced among trans persons in the context of suicide.

- abstract: "This essay considers the utility of research questions that
    articulate aspects of transgender lives to the nontransgender
    populations with whom they share a wide range of bodily and lived
    experience. By foregrounding transgender's instability as a research
    variable, the authors argue for more precise methodological
    orientations in trans research, particularly regarding gender and
    sexual orientation. Drawing on their own data with trans men whose
    sexual attractions have shifted during transition, they argue
    against unidimensional interpretations of this experience. Feminists
    and critical race scholars suggest that race and gender frequently
    function as \"proxies\": variables that reduce the complexities of
    biosocial bodily experience to more quantifiable forms of data. The
    authors argue that much of the research conducted with transgender
    persons suffers from similar reductions, narrowing the
    epistemological frameworks through which these populations are
    subsequently investigated and understood. By contrasting the
    National Transgender Discrimination Survey's focus on the measurable
    experience of discrimination with research that makes broader claims
    regarding \"the transgender population,\" the essay invites
    researchers to develop a set of best practices that resemble those
    of feminist science studies scholars."

- abstract: Interpersonal, social, and structural stressors have been
    identified as key elements that explain health disparities between
    transgender and cisgender individuals. However, most of this
    research has focused on binary transgender individuals or has not
    differentiated between binary and nonbinary individuals; little
    research has examined the experiences of minority stress or health
    of those identifying outside the gender binary. Guided by
    intersectionality and drawing on a sample of 3,568 college students
    from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health's 2012−2016
    database---of whom 892 identified outside the gender binary---we
    conducted analyses of demographic and outcome measures administered
    in participants' 1st counseling appointment, examining differences
    between cisgender, transgender, and genderqueer individuals. We
    found that genderqueer individuals were harassed, sexually abused,
    and subjected to traumatic events at higher rates than were either
    cisgender or binary transgender individuals, with approximately 50%
    of genderqueer individuals reporting one of these experiences. We
    found that genderqueer individuals experienced more anxiety,
    depression, psychological distress, and eating concerns than did
    binary transgender and cisgender individuals and more social anxiety
    than did cisgender individuals. Genderqueer individuals more
    frequently reported self-harm and suicidality than did any other
    group, with approximately 2/3 of participants' having contemplated
    and nearly 50% making a suicide attempt. We extend current
    theorizing about minority stress (Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Meyer,
    2003) to include genderqueer individuals and delineate several
    structural aspects of genderqueer experiences that may be
    responsible for these trends, including others' lack of knowledge
    about genderqueer experiences and pronouns, poor access to legal and
    medical resources, and systemic discrimination. (PsycInfo Database

- abstract: This research investigates transgender individuals'
    experiences with misgendering---the misclassification of gender
    identity---from a minority stress perspective. Four hundred and ten
    transgender individuals (M = 30.27 years, 83.9% European American)
    participated in a survey in which they reported how frequently they
    are misgendered and how stigmatized they feel when it occurs in
    addition to protective factors (gender identity importance, social
    support) and psychological distress (anxiety, depression, stress,
    transgender felt stigma). On average, participants reported being
    misgendered sometimes (M = 3.05, SD = 1.18) and feeling somewhat
    stigmatized by these experiences (M = 3.64, SD = 1.30). Perceived
    frequency of misgendering and feeling stigmatized by these
    experiences were positively associated with identity importance, but
    only perceived frequency was negatively associated with social
    support. Both perceived frequency and feeling stigmatized were
    positively associated with psychological distress. In turn, identity
    importance and social support were positively associated with
    psychological distress. There was a significant interaction between
    felt stigma and identity importance in predicting depression and
    stress. There was a positive association between felt stigma and
    stress and depression at low and high levels of identity importance,
    but this association was stronger at low levels of identity
    importance. In addition, there was a significant interaction between
    perceived frequency of misgendering and social support such that the
    association between perceived frequency and felt stigma was positive
    at low levels of social support but not at high levels of social
    support. In conclusion, misgendering is likely a novel minority
    stressor for transgender people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019

- abstract: "This study describes stress as derived from minority status
    and explores its effect on psychological distress in gay men. The
    concept of minority stress is based on the premise that gay people
    in a heterosexist society are subjected to chronic stress related to
    their stigmatization. Minority stressors were conceptualized as:
    internalized homophobia, which relates to gay men's direction of
    societal negative attitudes toward the self; stigma, which relates
    to expectations of rejection and discrimination; and actual
    experiences of discrimination and violence. The mental health
    effects of the three minority stressors were tested in a community
    sample of 741 New York City gay men. The results supported minority
    stress hypotheses: each of the stressors had a significant
    independent association with a variety of mental health measures.
    Odds ratios suggested that men who had high levels of minority
    stress were twice to three times as likely to suffer also from high
    levels of distress."

- abstract: In this article the author reviews research evidence on the
    prevalence of mental disorders in lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals
    (LGBs) and shows, using meta-analyses, that LGBs have a higher
    prevalence of mental disorders than heterosexuals. The author offers
    a conceptual framework for understanding this excess in prevalence
    of disorder in terms of minority stress--explaining that stigma,
    prejudice, and discrimination create a hostile and stressful social
    environment that causes mental health problems. The model describes
    stress processes, including the experience of prejudice events,
    expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, internalized
    homophobia, and ameliorative coping processes. This conceptual
    framework is the basis for the review of research evidence,
    suggestions for future research directions, and exploration of
    public policy implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA,

- abstract: Research suggests that transgender people face high levels
    of discrimination in society, which may contribute to their
    disproportionate risk for poor health. However, little is known
    about whether gender nonconformity, as a visible marker of one's
    stigmatized status as a transgender individual, heightens trans
    people's experiences with discrimination and, in turn, their health.
    Using data from the largest survey of transgender adults in the
    United States, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N =
    4,115), we examine the associations among gender nonconformity,
    transphobic discrimination, and health-harming behaviors (i.e.,
    attempted suicide, drug/alcohol abuse, and smoking). The results
    suggest that gender nonconforming trans people face more
    discrimination and, in turn, are more likely to engage in
    health-harming behaviors than trans people who are gender
    conforming. Our findings highlight the important role of gender
    nonconformity in the social experiences and well-being of
    transgender people.

- abstract: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth experience high rates
    of victimization leading to health disparities. Community size and
    community climate are associated with health outcomes among SGM
    youth; however, we lack studies that include them as covariates
    alongside victimization to understand their collective impact on
    health. This study utilized minority stress theory to understand how
    community context shapes experiences of victimization and health
    among SGM youth. SGM youth in one Midwestern U.S. state completed an
    online survey (n = 201) with measures of physical health, mental
    health, community context, and victimization. Data were analyzed via
    multiple regression using a path analysis framework. Results
    indicate that perceived climate was associated with mental, but not
    physical, health; Community size was unrelated to health outcomes.
    Victimization mediated the association between community climate and
    mental health. Findings are discussed in light of current literature
    and implications for research and practice are shared.

- abstract: "This study assessed individual (ie, internalized
    transphobia) and structural forms of stigma as risk factors for
    suicide attempts among transgender adults. Internalized transphobia
    was assessed through a 26-item scale including four dimensions:
    pride, passing, alienation, and shame. State-level structural stigma
    was operationalized as a composite index, including density of
    same-sex couples; proportion of Gay--Straight Alliances per public
    high school; 5 policies related to sexual orientation
    discrimination; and aggregated public opinion toward homosexuality.
    Multivariable logistic generalized estimating equation models
    assessed associations of interest among an online sample of
    transgender adults (N = 1,229) representing 48 states and the
    District of Columbia. Lower levels of structural stigma were
    associated with fewer lifetime suicide attempts (AOR 0.96, 95% CI
    0.92--0.997), and a higher score on the internalized transphobia
    scale was associated with greater lifetime suicide attempts (AOR
    1.18, 95% CI 1.04--1.33). Addressing stigma at multiple levels is
    necessary to reduce the vulnerability of suicide attempts among
    transgender adults."

- abstract: "Purpose: Transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC)
    individuals often are the target of enacted or external (i.e.,
    distal) experiences of stigma, discrimination, and violence, which
    are linked to adverse health, particularly psychological distress.
    There is limited research, however, examining felt or internal
    (i.e., proximal) stressors faced by TGNC individuals. This study
    sought to examine one type of internal stressor, expecting
    rejection, and aimed to (1) identify how and to what extent
    rejection expectations operate day-to-day for TGNC individuals and
    (2) explore how TGNC individuals respond to expectations of
    rejection.Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 30
    participants from 2014 to 2015 who identified as TGNC (mean
    age=30.4; 60% people of color); data were analyzed using a
    consensual qualitative research method.Results: Four thematic
    categories emerged about expecting rejection: (1) where to expect
    rejection; (2) thoughts and feelings associated with expectations of
    rejection; (3) coping strategies used to manage the expectation of
    rejection; and (4) the intersection of race and ethnicity with
    rejection expectations.Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest
    that expecting rejection is a frequent and salient internal stressor
    for TGNC individuals. We discuss the psychological and cumulative
    potential health impact of minority stress, and the applicability of
    Meyer's Minority Stress Model. Therapeutic interventions are needed
    to address the specific cognitive, emotional, and behavioral
    responses TGNC individuals experience as a result of the stress
    associated with expecting rejection, including fear, anxiety, and
    situational avoidance."

    female-to-male respondents, both prior awareness and prior
    engagement with other transgender people were independently related
    to less fearfulness, less suicidality, and more comfort. These
    relationships were not significant among male-to-different-gender or
    female-to-different-gender participants. Implications of these
    findings are discussed.

- abstract: Although research has consistently shown that individuals
    who identify as transgender have increased rates of mental health
    difficulties compared to their cisgender peers, less is known about
    the psychological mechanisms that convey this heightened risk. The
    data analyzed here were collected through the Wake Forest Well Being
    Assessment, which was conducted at 28 U.S. colleges and
    universities. The sample included 372 transgender college students
    who completed measures of discrimination, belonging, loneliness,
    depression, and anxiety. The results demonstrated an indirect
    association such that participants who reported more domains of
    discrimination reported lower belonging, which was associated with
    greater loneliness, which was associated with greater depression and
    anxiety. Ultimately, the findings of the present study provided
    further support of the psychological mediation model and can be used
    to inform interventions.

The experience of being transgender in the United States has shifted in ways that were hard for me to foresee the day I picked up the June 9, 2014 issue of *TIME* magazine from a large chain bookshop in Spartanburg, South Carolina. It had been four years since I started my own medical transition in a doctor's office two miles away from where I sat in my overstuffed chair, drinking my over-steamed latte, sheepishly reading a magazine suggesting I could maybe calm down a little bit with my social gender dysphoria. We had reached a *tipping point*, after all. To be sure, there has been an unimaginable increase in the general public's awareness of transgender experience. An increased presence in scripted, reality, and news media has resulted in trans people and their concerns taking up otherwise inaccessible space in the minds and homes of millions of people (Billard and Gross 2020; Capuzza and Spencer 2018). As awareness continues to increase and more trans people feel comfortable being visible as such in their everyday lives, our central social institutions are being pushed by diverse factions of stakeholders to either facilitate or eliminate gender diversity. Increased activity meant to empower or constrain gender diversity has emerged in nearly every social context and institution.

Seven years after Black transgender actress and activist Laverne Cox appeared on the cover of *TIME*, we seem to have reached another tipping point. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) named 2021 the most active year on record for anti-trans legislation in the United States (Krishnakumar 2021). Right wing activists and anti-trans lawmakers tested out the viability of their approaches in statehouses across the country in 2021, slightly tweaking them at each iteration to see which approach would hold up under legal scrutiny (strict or otherwise). In many cases, trans and queer activists worked tirelessly to defeat these proposals. They organized public protests and facilitated outreach campaigns; they attended state and local legislative sessions and gave impassioned public testimony on behalf of trans youth and young adults; they created community care spaces to process the political moment and facilitate the provision of direct services and mutual aid during the onslaught of attacks; they built coalitions made up of diverse stakeholders, trans people, and cis allies who were already leading a variety of social justice organizations across their communities (e.g., Branigin 2021; Brown 2022; Rummler 2022). Working together, these activists demonstrated the kind of power that can be seized when individuals come together as a community, make the decision to approach social problems with a collective orientation, and combine resources so that everyone has what they need to contribute to the best of their ability. Unfortunately, these efforts also revealed the limitations of our power and the remaining work that is required from all of us beyond the defensive strategy of political whack-a-mole that has gripped our movement in recent years.

In 2022, we are witnessing the renewal of this legislative harassment. State and local lawmakers concentrated in the US Southeast, but increasingly spread out around the country, have already put pen to paper to prevent and sanction the provision of life-saving medical care to trans kids and young adults; rule out the acknowledgement of trans and queer identities in public education; make it illegal for trans kids to play sports on teams that reflect their gender identity; punish people for using the restroom or a fitting room in a public space; offer safe harbor to those who shapeshift religious doctrine to condemn, rather than love, thy neighbor; and in some cases to frame the provision of support by a parent, caregiver, teacher, or other authority figure as child abuse or grooming (e.g., Burns 2022; Carlisle 2022; Ishisaka 2022; Yi 2022). To rally support, proponents of this legislation rely on tropes that stigmatize trans, nonbinary, and gender diverse people as dangerous, predatory, deceptive, and sociopathic (Sessa-Hawkins 2021).

An especially cruel and harmful component of the recent string of negative policy proposals, the majority of this legislative harassment targets trans youth and young adults, as well as the adults or authority figures in their lives who might offer them support and resources (e.g., Branigin 2022; Sosin 2022). Even when bills are defeated, and conservative activists are unable to use the power of law to control trans people, the rhetoric does a fair amount of the job for them. A research group in the United States conducted focus groups with trans and gender diverse youth to explore the perceived impact of the political climate on young trans people's well-being (Paceley et al. 2020; Paceley et al. 2021). They found that anti-trans rhetoric leads to the development of dangerous social environments, noting increased suicidal ideation, increased feelings of isolation, and decreased self-worth (Paceley et al. 2020). Ultimately, this rhetoric leads to increased psychological distress among trans youth, and "emboldens peers to perpetuate bias-based bullying and harassment, which is itself associated with poor mental health, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, poor academic performance, and substance abuse among \[trans and gender-diverse\] people" (Paceley et al. 2021, 3).

## Socio-political reverb

When these bills are passed into law and, importantly, even when they are resoundingly defeated or fail to reach an actual vote, anti-trans lawmakers and their allies manufacture and encourage the spread of harmful rhetoric and ideology that is necessary to support the content of their legislation (Billard 2021). In turn, this arms everyday citizens with dangerous ammunition and deputizes them in the culture war fever dreams of right-wing America. In Texas, pharmacists are reporting parents of trans children to child protective services---scaring, threatening, and potentially dividing families who are following current standards of care as outlined by national and international medical authorities (Sosin 2022; Yurcaba 2022). In Alabama, schoolteachers are outing trans kids to their parents and peers, placing them at risk of emotional abuse, physical violence, and potential abandonment (Cohen 2022). Under the guise of protecting children, these consequences put trans, nonbinary, and gender diverse youth and young adults directly in harm's way.

Even when they are defeated, efforts at enacting anti-trans legislation have widespread effects for trans, nonbinary, and gender diverse people. The rhetorical and ideological work that goes into attempts at discriminatory policies affects outsider views of trans people, but that work also contributes to internalized stigma, poor mental health, and expectations of poor treatment, thus creating a hostile social climate and poor outlook for trans people (e.g., Grzenda et al. 2021). This socio-political reverb results in disparate life chances and disproportionate disadvantage throughout the life course and across social contexts and institutions.

The minority stress model was originally developed to connect lesbian women's (Brooks 1981; Rich et al. 2020), and later gay men's (Meyer 1995, 2003), experiences of poor mental health to the heteronormative social conflicts they experience related to their sexuality. Importantly, this model was developed to push back against the widespread assumptions that lesbians and gay men experienced negative mental health outcomes due to a sexual minority identity in and of itself. According to the minority stress perspective, the social stigma attached to sexual minorities---and not merely a sexual minority identity---results in a lower social status for lesbians and gay men. Lower status, according to the theory, results in higher rates of prejudice and discrimination and the accumulation of fewer resources with which to cope. According to the minority stress model, the experience of negative life events, their anticipation, and the internalization of their meaning leads to poor mental health outcomes for sexual minorities.

The minority stress model was later expanded to explain the high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidality among trans people. Rather than poor mental health outcomes being a characteristic of trans identity, psychologists Michael L. Hendricks and Rylan J. Testa (2012) suggest that trans people experience gender minority stress that overlaps with and operates alongside sexual minority stress. Hendricks and Testa suggest a pathway from gender-related negative life events, the fear and anticipation of future negative events, and the internalization of transphobic stigma to suicidality and psychological distress among trans people. Trans-specific negative life events include a range of anti-trans experiences including microaggressions, rejection, emotional abuse, and physical violence. Whether the events are experienced or anticipated, their presence in the lives of trans people often results in hypervigilance, avoidance, and self-isolation (Rood et al. 2016), exacerbating mental health disparities and reducing coping resources.

As hostile political rhetoric aimed at trans people increases, so too do experiences of minority stress (Gonzalez et al. 2016). In this ongoing wave of legislative harassment, trans people are positioned as deranged, deceptive, and dangerous in order to justify state-sponsored control, discipline, and punishment. The ideology necessary to justify removing a child from a loving home because their parent or guardian filled a prescription, written by a licensed physician, for life-saving medical care, or the argument necessary to make sense of terminating a teacher who recommended a book from the library to a student who asked for literature that reflected gender-diverse experiences like their own, requires us to lower our expectations for the humanity of trans people. Low expectations allow the stigmatization of trans, nonbinary, and gender diverse people, heightening their chances of experiencing discrimination, rejection, or violence due to their gender identity. One research group found that transgender adults who live in US states with anti-trans policies report more suicide attempts than their peers in states without legislation that negatively targets their community (Perez-Brumer et al. 2015). In hostile political climates, encounters of anti-trans bias become ubiquitous, trans people come to expect them, and adapt their lives in order to avoid them (Rood et al. 2016). Over time, some trans people may accept this treatment and its associated implications, leading to even higher rates of depression, suicidality, and other negative mental health outcomes (Bradford et al. 2013; Goldblum et al. 2012; Herman 2013; Lefevor et al. 2019; McLemore 2018; Miller and Grollman 2015).

## Embodied knowledges

As a ninth-grade student in South Carolina, I got caught writing a note to my first girlfriend during my Spanish class. It was mostly benign, but definitely included cheesy high school crush stuff and angsty reflections on my growing gender dysphoria. I was embarrassed and a bit annoyed that my letter was taken, but assumed my teacher threw the note out. When it resurfaced a few weeks later at a parent-teacher conference, I had forgotten all about it. My mother always showed up to those conversations, and parent-teacher conferences were usually really good days for me; I was an anxious student, had very few friends, and focused on academic achievement as a means of control and a pathway out of my hometown. But my academic achievement was not the focus of the parent-teacher conference on that particular evening. My teacher thought that my sexuality and gender identity were more important topics to discuss with my mother than my ability to conjugate verbs. While the class note itself was standard fare for ninth-grade love---wistful longings, hyperbolic emotions, and way too much emphasis on lyrics from popular music---the object of my affections and the meanings attached to that were of the most concern to the adults in my life. When my mother walked out of my classroom, she called me a liar and said I had broken her trust. I've always felt like she never looked at me the same way again, never saw me quite the same way. My Spanish teacher stopped interacting with me or looking my way at all. As hard as I tried, I did not pick up the Spanish language that semester. "What did you expect?" Mama asked, in no way looking for an answer, when she saw my report card that term.

Around that same time, I was beginning to understand that my social status across a variety of institutions was directly connected to my gender nonconformity and its impact on others' perception of my sexuality. At home, school, church, and other community spaces, where I was once held in high esteem as the well-behaved child, the straight-A student, or the youth group leader, I was now considered untrustworthy, a disruption, and a bad influence. My expectations fell alongside my social esteem, and I came to anticipate a world that was hostile to people like me. I began to expect that mistreatment would come my way, and that expectation changed how I understood my place in the world. Over time, I withdrew from friends and family, and my faith in social institutions steadily declined.

Like many people, for better or worse, I came to know trans people and the trans community through media representations. Likewise, I came to understand the social sanctions that would befall me if my gender rejected a cisnormative standpoint. The first trans man that I ever encountered was through film. His name was Brandon Teena. He died in Humboldt, Nebraska from a gunshot wound on December 31, 1993. He also died from stigma, as local authorities mocked, dismissed, and failed to protect him after he reported being brutally attacked by the two men who, days later, murdered him and his friends in a revenge plot. At thirteen years old, I grieved with those who loved him, as I watched the film *Boys Don\'t Cry* on a loop. I did not know at the time why I was so moved by this story of a transgender man. I did know, somehow implicitly, that I should hide my grief. Upon one viewing, I was interrupted by my mother's boyfriend. Feeling the need to defend my emotions, I said, "People are so cruel." He snapped back, "What did you expect?"

Ten years later, I saw the film again as a college student, attending a screening for an LGBTQ cultural event on campus. Those same giant feelings of grief returned to my chest, the ones that would show up when I was caught off guard by having a gender experience that was understood as trans. By the time we reached the violent climax in the narrative arc of the film, the other attendees watched in horror as emotional, physical, and sexual violence was inflicted on this young trans man. I quickly excused myself before the final shot and the follow up panel discussion. I was angry at the event organizers for screening this film. I was angry with my friends for being shocked by trans-antagonistic violence. I was angry at myself for identifying with Brandon. I repeated the words of my parents in my head, *what did you expect,* as I sped away from campus. When I reached the parking lot of the hotel-turned-low-income-student-housing where I lived near campus, I thought my grief would swallow me whole. It would be a few more years before I would understand that grief as part of my own gender experience, less tied to the tragedy of Brandon's life and death and more tied to how it reinforced the ideas I held related to my own.

I started my own gender transition process my first year of graduate school. This serendipitous intersection allowed me the opportunity to spend an enormous amount of time educating myself on all things trans. I read every article and book I could find on the subject. As I consumed all of this content, I recognized similar feelings of grief that had nearly consumed me years prior, first in middle school and again in college as I came to understand my identity through the life and death of Brandon Teena. I began to wonder what I may have thought about trans experience (my own and others') and how my self-concept and identity may have been different if a Hollywood version of Brandon Teena had not been my first trans peer. I wanted to understand how trans people were given the cultural material to make sense of themselves. I wanted to understand the possibilities of what we could expect for ourselves and from those in our lives.

The first piece of independent research that I did in graduate school was a content analysis of documentary film focused on trans men and trans masculinity. One of the first films that I found was *Southern Comfort,* the story of Robert Eads. Robert died in Toccoa, Georgia from ovarian cancer on January 17, 1999. He also died from stigma, as provider after provider denied him necessary treatment due to his trans status. Robert explained that providers were more concerned about the comfort of their other patients than they were for his life. I grieved with his chosen family, more than a decade after his death, as I watched the end of his life play out on screen. He smoked cigarettes, drank coffee, and spoke in a thick southern accent about the medical providers who had left him for dead. His drawl comforted me, bringing the possibility of southern trans experience into being even as it was narrating the premature end to his own life. As Robert recalled his failed attempts to access life-saving medical care, I remembered medical providers an hour and a half north of Toccoa, more than a decade after Robert's death, refusing to touch me or look me in the eyes as I sought gender-affirming care. I was not shocked to hear that Robert's experiences had been much worse than my own had been to that point; I had learned to expect that they would be.

Around the same time that I was grieving for Robert Eads, a Southern trans elder I would never have the opportunity to meet, several of my friends from college started to identify as trans. One came out by sharing a link to a video he posted on his YouTube channel, where he had been documenting his experience of social and medical transition. I watched the videos with mixed feelings. I was excited for my friend, and for myself knowing another trans man in real life. Yet, I was incredibly scared for him, for us. What could we expect? In one of his videos, he described the loneliness he felt as a trans man in the South, lamented a future that he may never get to see, and floated the idea of moving to the West Coast in search of community. (All trans masculine Google searches seemed to lead to the Bay Area in 2011.) This is what I expected. A few videos later, he had decided to stay put and build a community of his own. Alongside a couple of friends in a coffee shop one afternoon, he started Gender Benders (GB), a grassroots support group for trans, nonbinary, and gender diverse people in the area. Within a few months, the group was thriving. That is *not* what I expected.

On a few trips back home, I attended some of the GB coffee meetups or group hangouts. I got to know other trans people from the area, heard their stories of family and community, and started to recognize the limitations of my expectations related to trans life. By this point, my college friend who helped start the group had moved on to other opportunities and to seek other resources. Yet, the leadership built on the connections made over weekly coffee meetups, expanding the organization's local and online presence, and eventually providing resources and community to thousands of trans Southerners. Much like my friend, most folks involved in the organization come and go as their needs are met or as their needs change. In the summer of 2014, I attended Camp GB, a long-weekend retreat for trans folks to spend time in community and to access resources. It was the first time that I had been in a space that was completely centered on and designed by trans people. In that environment, I was able to develop a more well-rounded set of expectations about trans life in the region, and a better understanding of my own needs as a trans Southerner. I realized that I needed trans connection, and I needed to do whatever I could to make sure others had access to trans community.

In the summer of 2015, I attended camp as a member of the leadership team. The group had grown significantly, gathered a lot of support, and was ready to move beyond donated air mattresses and makeshift basement dorms. We looked around and found the perfect spot in the north Georgia foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a picturesque campground tucked away in the woods of Toccoa, Georgia. It was not until we pulled our own caravan of trans cowboys through the town that Robert Eads referred to as "bubba town" that I remembered that this was where he spent the 53 years of his life.

Over the next several years, we would bring hundreds of trans Southerners to Toccoa, providing our community with access to mental and physical healthcare; peer connection and social support; recreation and fellowship; skill-building for grantmaking and community organizing; and a relaxing retreat that was centered on trans people caring for and loving other trans people. We ate every meal together in the large camp dining hall. We laughed, played games, and had fun together. We cried and processed our grief together. And we built relationships that helped us see and love ourselves in ways that had previously been denied to us. At Camp GB, we raised each other's expectations, and we sought to exceed them every time we came together.

## Oppositional knowledges

Peer support plays an outsized role in interrupting the psychological consequences of stigma, discrimination, and other identity-related stress among trans people. Indicating access to peers, and the potential support they may offer, is directly related to lower levels of distress among trans people in the bulk of psychological research on the subject. This work notes that peer support is a protective factor against mental health issues broadly and against gender-related psychological distress in particular. For example, Bariola and colleagues (2015) and Testa and colleagues (2014) show that when trans people have more frequent contact with their peers they are able to develop greater resilience.

In my own and others' research on trans and gender-diverse Southerners, a regular theme emerges indicating that one way that sourcing support from the trans community facilitates positive mental health is through self-acceptance and the acceptance of trans identity broadly. By coming into contact with community-based counter-narratives to the rhetoric of legislative harassment, trans people gain access to a new way of framing their experiences. This new frame situates their gender experiences within a community of shared others, provides them language for explaining their experiences to others, and potentially normalizes their previously stigmatized experiences of gender for them and others in their lives.

Philosopher Talia Mae Bettcher wrote in 2007 that framing trans people as "evil deceivers and make-believers" transforms us into villains deserving of the rude, hostile, and violent reactions received from those uncomfortable with, offended by, or surprised by our gendered bodies, identities, or experiences (see also Billard 2019). As Bettcher argued, the stigma that is attached to our identities, and the framing used to justify interpersonal violence against us, poses the sometimes silent, sometimes roaring question, *what did you expect?* Before trans was an identity or experience that was intelligible to me, I did not have access to the collective knowledge necessary to form an oppositional viewpoint of my mistreatment. I was unable to separate others' reactions to my gender nonconformity from its (and ultimately my own) inherent value.

As communication scholar Sarah E. Jones (2020, 268) writes, when trans people do not have the resources to challenge them, cisnormative

> ways of knowing can function as a deterministic power---molding who trans people can be, how they exist in the world, and what rights they do or do not have \[\...\] by controlling the social, organizational, and legal opportunities available.

It was not until I encountered trans ways of knowing through interaction with other trans people and gained insider explanations for my experiences within trans-centered community, that I was able to develop what sociologist KL Broad (2001) termed a "transgender standpoint." That is, my connection to a collective transgender identity enabled a way of knowing gender that included, explained, and celebrated those of us who operate outside of its normative construction. In Broad's (2001, 1151) conceptualization, a transgender standpoint questions "the dominant gender categorization system that assumes stable gender categories." Further, Broad (2001, 1151--52) writes:

> a transgender standpoint might examine how the processes of binary gender constraints (in medicine, psychology, and law) serve to pathologize transgender expression (such that transgender individuals disproportionately end up under medical supervision or in the criminal justice system) and marginalize transgender people from gendered social structures (e.g., sex-segregated jobs and marriage, etc.) and services (e.g., welfare and child support).

As a young person attempting to make sense of my own experiences of gender and the reactions it prompted from others in my life, a cisnormative standpoint was the only one available to me. Through trans community, I was able to access a transgender standpoint that radically reframed my expectations and explanations for the treatment I received as a trans person. As Bariola and colleagues (2015, 2112) write, "for marginalized people, identification with similar others allows for the development of a positive in-group identity, encourages positive self-appraisal, and allows access to group-level coping."

Testa and colleagues (2014) explain that simply having a prior awareness that other trans people exist and prior engagement with trans people enhances psychological well-being when trans people first begin to explore their identities. During early trans identity development, these factors may result in trans people being less fearful, less suicidal, and more comfortable in their newly formed identity. Knowing that trans people exist and having previous interaction with trans people was so influential to mental health that, in one study, it cut the rates of suicide in half (Testa et al. 2014). This body of scholarship provides "support for the value of transgender individuals connecting with similar others, possibly providing the opportunity to question stigma from the majority culture and reappraise their experiences in a self-affirmative way" (Bockting et al. 2013, 949).

A growing number of studies suggest peer support is especially powerful when it occurs within trans community spaces. In and through connections with trans community organizations, individual trans people are offered a structure that facilitates the content, timing, availability, and distribution of peer connections. In an article I co-authored with my colleague Baker Rogers (Johnson and Rogers 2020), we show that some peer support structures, like those that offer regular opportunities for creating and maintaining relationships with other trans people, facilitate strong networks and norms through regular, intentional programming that destigmatizes and normalizes gender diversity, while encouraging positive frames for understanding a range of trans experiences.

## Structural competency

Both as an academic researcher and in collaboration with community partners, I have completed over five years of ethnographic fieldwork, conducted more than 100 in-depth one-on-one interviews, and conducted 10 focus groups across the South, as well as surveyed more than 5,000 trans, nonbinary, and gender diverse Southerners. The first takeaway from this mass of data is clear: peer support is a gamechanger for the mental, physical, and social well-being of individual trans people. The power of peer support for the well-being of trans people is not a new finding. From the natural and social sciences to the fine arts and humanities, scholars thinking and writing about trans people consistently report that peer connections lead to positive outcomes (Armangau and Figeac 2022; Fairchild 2022; Gosling et al. 2021; Johnson and Rogers 2020; Kia et al. 2021; Wilson and Liss 2022; Worrell et al. 2022).

However, the *structural* dynamics of peer support are often overlooked by researchers, whose unstated assumptions are that the benefits of peer connection are consequences of organic one-on-one relationships. The scholarship that documents the effects of this support tends to neglect those who are facilitating this resource for their communities. A key consequence of this neglect is a partial understanding of the potential and impact of peer support for those receiving it, as well as those facilitating it. As Joksimovíc (2020, 126) writes, leaving these leaders out of the collective conversation is a form of "systemic erasure" and "epistemic injustice." Not only does it erase their accomplishments, but it erases the price they pay and the personal resources that they are required to use to achieve them.

An additional takeaway of my own community-based research into trans community emerges as a signpost guiding us to act, while warning us of the risks: Embeddedness in trans community shifts some of the burden of identifying, locating, and accessing that support from individual trans people in need to the grassroots leaders who are organizing it and facilitating others' access to it. The burden of individuals managing cisnormative ways of knowing and being does not disappear in the presence of peer support. Rather, it is transferred to other individuals: leaders who are organizing peer support groups and social gatherings; connecting trans youth to opportunities for self-expression through advocacy, activism, and the arts; educating their neighbors, including K--12 teachers, healthcare providers, social service agents, and other resource gatekeepers or state actors in their communities; and, when traditional service infrastructure fails, organizing events or paying out of their own pockets in order to provide healthcare, food, education, and housing to trans people in their communities.

Since my first weekend at Camp GB in 2014, I have tried to understand how its components could be scaled up to bring the most trans people into community with each other, provide the best resources, and do the work to shift institutional norms in favor of trans lives. Community leaders' aptitude for and commitment to creating and providing resources for others is rooted in their embodied knowledge of familial alienation, resource deprivation, and social isolation. It is strengthened by the oppositional knowledge gained from the collective creation of a transgender standpoint. We might understand trans grassroots labor by situating it in what Hil Malatino (2022, 48) refers to as a "t4t praxis of love" that is about "being with and bearing with; about witnessing one another, being mirrors for one another that avoid some of the not-so-funhouse effects of cisnormative perceptive habits that frame trans folk as too much, not enough, failed or not yet realized." To scale up the transformative power of grassroots trans labor, we must first provide for the trans people who have accepted the burden of this praxis. To maximize the potential of this t4t praxis of love, however, we must raise our collective expectations of where and how trans people are allowed to come together and support each other, and which institutions and individuals we hold accountable to making that happen.

Rather than shifting fully to a mutual aid model of trans community support, defined by Dean Spade (2020, 7) as the "collective coordination to meet each other's needs, usually stemming from an awareness that the systems we have in place are not going to meet them," we must build structural competency by holding social institutions accountable to a praxis of love for transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse people. In practice, this looks like everyday institutions engaging with the embodied and oppositional knowledges of trans people---listening and responding to our experiences, needs, and desires---without adding to the burden of the trans people they serve, or those who occupy positions in their organizations. One pathway to structural competency is an institutional investment in applied transgender studies scholarship, a field that is determined and uniquely situated to "identify, analyze, and ultimately, improve the material conditions transgender people face in daily life" (Billard et al. 2021; see also Billard, Everhart, and Zhang 2022). This competency takes shape when institutions move beyond inclusion (Johnson 2015) to anticipate and intentionally design for, rather than merely respond to, gender diversity by creating spaces that center trans bodies, trans minds, and trans emotions. Engaging with applied trans studies scholarship facilitates this competency by expanding institutional definitions of gender---requiring institutional stakeholders to rethink who and what counts as trans (Labuski and Keo-Meier 2015)---so that they may account for a range of gendered experiences in their policies and practices. Through structural competency, our everyday institutions become robust against sociopolitical tipping points that destabilize trans communities. Through a reliance on applied trans studies scholarship, rather than partisan talking points, institutions may design for empowerment and guard against constraint for transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse people.
