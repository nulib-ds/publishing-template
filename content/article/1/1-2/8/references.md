- abstract: This chapter aims to analyze the sociabilities,
    information-sharing behaviors, and types of social support among
    users of French non-mixed trans Facebook groups. First, our national
    survey (N = 405) reveals that the different uses of these groups
    (information retrieval, emotional support, etc.) vary according to
    the age and education levels of their trans users, or according to
    their progress on the transition pathways. Second, we perform a
    lexical analysis of the messages (N = 70,488) posted, since 2013, in
    a sample of 24 groups, in order to identify the main topics of
    discussion. This analysis leads us to emphasize the diversity of
    social support provided by trans people to one another, via posts
    and comments. These findings deemphasize the benefits of
    institutional support because they suggest, alternatively, that
    trans people are organizing themselves to avoid challenges
    associated with medical institutions and the French "therapeutic
    shield.. Such individuals use Facebook to this end, sharing
    information or support in order to create a safe space managed with
    a transfeminist ethic, and allowing themselves to make
    gender-related choices more autonomously, far away from normative
    judgements (in particular those expressed by the medical
    profession).

- abstract: Objectives. We examined the independent demographic and
    psychosocial factors associated with psychological distress and
    resilience among transgender men and women.Methods. Our data came
    from an online survey involving a national Australian sample of 169
    transgender men and women in 2011. Survey questions assessed
    demographics; sources of support; contact with lesbian, gay,
    bisexual, and transgender peers; and experiences of victimization.
    We assessed the outcomes with the Kessler Psychological Distress
    Scale and the Brief Resilience Scale.Results. In all, 46.0% of the
    sample reported high or very high levels of psychological distress.
    Multivariable regression analyses identified considerably different
    independent factors for psychological distress and resilience.
    Younger age, feeling unable to turn to family for support, and
    victimization experiences were associated with greater psychological
    distress, whereas higher income, identifying as heterosexual, and
    having frequent contact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
    peers were associated with greater resilience.Conclusions. With
    different factors identified for psychological distress and
    resilience, these findings may help inform the development of
    tailored mental health interventions and resilience-building
    programs for this vulnerable population.

- abstract: This essay examines the stereotype that transgender people
    are "deceivers" and the stereotype's role in promoting and excusing
    transphobic violence. The stereotype derives from a contrast between
    gender presentation (appearance) and sexed body (concealed reality).
    Because gender presentation represents genital status, Bettcher
    argues, people who "misalign" the two are viewed as deceivers. The
    author shows how this system of gender presentation as genital
    representation is part of larger sexist and racist systems of
    violence and oppression.

- abstract: Objectives. We assessed the association between minority
    stress, mental health, and potential ameliorating factors in a
    large, community-based, geographically diverse sample of the US
    transgender population.Methods. In 2003, we recruited through the
    Internet a sample of 1093 male-to-female and female-to-male
    transgender persons, stratified by gender. Participants completed an
    online survey that included standardized measures of mental health.
    Guided by the minority stress model, we evaluated associations
    between stigma and mental health and tested whether indicators of
    resilience (family support, peer support, identity pride) moderated
    these associations.Results. Respondents had a high prevalence of
    clinical depression (44.1%), anxiety (33.2%), and somatization
    (27.5%). Social stigma was positively associated with psychological
    distress. Peer support (from other transgender people) moderated
    this relationship. We found few differences by gender
    identity.Conclusions. Our findings support the minority stress
    model. Prevention needs to confront social structures, norms, and
    attitudes that produce minority stress for gender-variant people;
    enhance peer support; and improve access to mental health and social
    services that affirm transgender identity and promote resilience.

- abstract: Objectives. We examined relationships between social
    determinants of health and experiences of transgender-related
    discrimination reported by transgender people in Virginia.Methods.
    In 2005 through 2006, 387 self-identified transgender people
    completed a statewide health needs assessment; 350 who completed
    eligibility questions were included in this examination of factors
    associated with experiences of discrimination in health care,
    employment, or housing. We fit multivariate logistic regression
    models using generalized estimating equations to adjust for survey
    modality (online vs paper).Results. Of participants, 41% (n = 143)
    reported experiences of transgender-related discrimination. Factors
    associated with transgender-related discrimination were geographic
    context, gender (female-to male spectrum vs male-to-female
    spectrum), low socioeconomic status, being a racial/ethnic minority,
    not having health insurance, gender transition indicators (younger
    age at first transgender awareness), health care needed but unable
    to be obtained (hormone therapy and mental health services), history
    of violence (sexual and physical), substance use health behaviors
    (tobacco and alcohol), and interpersonal factors (family support and
    community connectedness).Conclusions. Findings suggest that
    transgender Virginians experience widespread discrimination in
    health care, employment, and housing. Multilevel interventions are
    needed for transgender populations, including legal protections and
    training for health care providers.

- abstract: This study explored representation of lead and supporting
    transgender characters in nine U.S. scripted television dramas and
    comedies aired 2008--2014. Employing qualitative content analysis
    techniques, episodes were coded for casting, visibility, identity,
    embodiment, and social interaction. Findings suggested that scripted
    television has begun to evolve in a manner that relies less on a
    standardized narrative and one-dimensional characterization of
    transgender people. The formerly ubiquitous "wrong body" discourse
    seems to have ebbed in favor of more diverse and refined stories
    about transgender identity and subjectivity. However, increased
    visibility does not apply across the spectrum of transgender
    identity and expression. Transgender people as a population and a
    political community, trans men, and genderqueer characters remain
    largely invisible.

- abstract: "Trans students at New College of Florida provide
    overwhelmingly positive assessments of their campus culture as
    related to issues of gender identity, a stark contrast to existing
    literature on gender-nonconforming collegians. This chapter examines
    the interactional processes that create a context supportive of all
    genders -- the ways students are expected to act toward one another
    and how they hold each other accountable to these norms. I draw on
    interviews with 24 students with diverse identities to argue: (1)
    there is a trans-inclusive understanding of gender that is dominant
    on campus, (2) the students have norms that reflect the inclusive
    understanding and provide direction for when and how gender should
    enter interactions, and (3) swift responses to breaches of
    interactional norms serve to support gender-nonconforming students
    and affirm the identity of the community as unwilling to tolerate
    transphobia. This analysis demonstrates an alternative cultural
    context, one in which community members are held not to conventional
    expectations associated with assumed sex category, but to an
    understanding of gender that does not take identity for granted. In
    so doing, it highlights how shifts in shared understanding can
    create more inclusive interactional practices. Additionally, the
    focus on the meaning underlying social processes suggests that
    shifts in how people think about gender could similarly lead to
    alteration of organizational structures that would help trans
    students thrive."

- abstract: This article presents empirical research findings from a
    subsample of 290 transgender participants in the Virginia
    Transgender Health Initiative Survey (THIS) who reported whether or
    not they had experienced hostility or insensitivity related to their
    gender identity or expression during high school, termed in-school
    gender-based victimization (GBV). The purpose of this study was to
    assess the impact of in-school GBV on rates of suicide attempts
    among transgender people. Of the 290 respondents, 44.8% reported
    they had experienced in-school GBV, and 28.5% reported a history of
    suicide attempt. Among those who had attempted, 32.5% reported
    having made one attempt, 28.6% reported a history of two attempts,
    and 39.0% reported having made three or more attempts. Participants
    who reported experiencing GBV were approximately four times more
    likely to have attempted suicide than those who did not. Among the
    subgroups of 147 trans women and 81 trans men, GBV was associated
    both with history of suicide attempt, and with a higher number of
    suicide attempts over the life span. Implications for policy and
    clinical interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

- abstract: Background The impact of Minority Stress (MS) upon suicidal
    ideation and behaviours amongst Transgender and Gender
    Non-Conforming (TGNC) adults is not sufficiently understood, hence
    our intervention efforts on an individual and societal level are
    limited. This review aims to evaluate recent literature that reports
    on the association between MS and suicidal ideation and behaviours
    amongst TGNC adults. Methods PsycINFO, Web of Science, MEDLINE,
    CINAHL and EMBASE were systematically searched for relevant
    articles. Peer reviewed and grey literature were considered.
    Included papers reported quantitative analyses on associations
    between MS factors and suicidal ideation and behaviours amongst TGNC
    adults. The quality of papers was assessed. Results 28 papers were
    identified as eligible. Findings suggested positive associations
    between external and internal minority stressors and suicidal
    ideation and behaviour. Dysfunctional individual coping was
    associated with a greater likelihood of suicide attempts. Community
    resilience was negatively associated with suicidal outcomes, but did
    not consistently buffer the effects of minority stress. Limitations
    Overall quality of included papers was 'poor'. Almost all papers
    were cross-sectional by design, therefore causality cannot be
    inferred. Many papers measured variables using non-standardised
    measures undermining the reliability and validity of reported
    results. Conclusions Findings offer support to the application of MS
    theory to the understanding of suicidal ideation and behaviour
    amongst TGNC. Future research should use standardised measures and
    longitudinal designs to better support the investigation of
    directionality and causality. More research is needed to understand
    the complex interactions between minority stress factors and the
    role of resilience in this population.

- abstract: Purpose In this chapter, I assess the treatment of
    transgender within the sociology of gender and propose a new
    standard of transfeminist methodology that would work against
    transgender marginalization in social scientific research.
    Methodology/approach I assess the treatment of transgender within
    the sociology of gender by conducting a content analysis of all
    articles and chapters focusing on transgender people, experiences,
    bodies, and phenomena published between 1987 and 2014 in the journal
    Gender & Society (n = 12) and between 1996 and 2014 in the book
    series Advances in Gender Research (n = 5). Findings I first outline
    key tenets of feminist methodology and suggest additional
    transfeminist methodological considerations. I proceed to a content
    analysis of existing transgender research in two key publications to
    support my proposal of the development of transfeminist methodology.
    Originality/value This chapter highlights the need to expand
    feminist methodology for the study of transgender people and
    phenomena. Specifically, I propose the development of transfeminist
    methodology, an approach that centers on transgender experience and
    perspectives.

- abstract: "This article uses ethnographic methods to explore how peer
    support and community involvement influence the mental health and
    well-being of transgender (or, trans) people in the southeastern
    United States. The study builds on existing research that suggests
    that trans community involvement and peer support among trans people
    enhance mental health experiences and moderate the effects of stigma
    and discrimination on health outcomes. Through qualitative analysis
    of 158 hours of participant observation and 33 in-depth interviews
    with members of a trans community organization in the U.S.
    Southeast, this paper identifies three key processes through which
    peer support and community involvement enhance the mental health and
    well-being of trans people: (1) the normalization of trans
    identities and experiences; (2) the creation of a social support
    network; and (3) the empowerment of trans people."

- abstract: The status of transgender rights presents a national crisis,
    and organizational communication scholars must mobilize activist
    scholarship in which the "T" in "LGBT" (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
    transgender) matters in the argument presented and changes proposed.
    The purpose of this study was (a) to acknowledge transgender members
    as worthy of focused organizational study and (b) to theorize a
    transgender standpoint epistemology in an organizational
    context---an epistemology rooted in a standpoint marginalized at the
    societal level, within the LGBT community, and in communication
    scholarship. I discuss my collaboration with a community
    organization called Trans\*Spectrum, where I conducted 10 in-depth
    interviews with transgender employees. The study illustrates how
    gender identity, performativities, and presentation, as well as
    agency and privilege, coalesce within the bounds of organizational
    rules and norms to permit only certain bodies to navigate the
    workplace in particular, uniform ways. The results show how
    organizations could better curate spaces for acknowledgment,
    accommodation, and acceptance.

- abstract: Rationale There is a growing body of research involving
    transgender (trans) individuals that foregrounds elevated rates of
    suicidality in trans populations. Although peer support is
    increasingly studied as a protective factor against suicide among
    trans persons, the scholarship in this area continues to be limited
    and has yet to be synthesized and appraised. Objective In this
    paper, we address this existing gap in the literature by presenting
    the results of a scoping review of the literature examining the
    significance and function of peer support in mitigating suicide risk
    in trans populations. Methods This scoping review is based on an
    analysis of 34 studies that were included following the execution of
    a methodical search and selection process. Drawing on scoping review
    methodology, along with PRISMA-P guidelines, we selected
    peer-reviewed empirical works, published between 2000 and 2020,
    which examined relationships between providing, seeking, and/or
    receiving peer support and suicide risk in trans populations.
    Results Our findings, which are conceptualized using the minority
    stress model as a guiding theoretical framework, reveal that while
    the literature generally substantiates the protective significance
    of peer support for trans persons, a small body of work also
    uncovers novel and unanticipated sources of peer support, including
    social support offered by trans peers online, which are infrequently
    and inconsistently examined in this body of scholarship. Conclusions
    Using our appraisal of the literature, we outline the need for
    future research to further elucidate the significance and function
    of peer support in protecting against suicide among trans persons.
    In particular, we discuss the need for exploratory inquiry to inform
    a conceptualization and operationalization of peer support that more
    fully and consistently accounts for how such support (including
    online and community-based support) is sought, received, and
    experienced among trans persons in the context of suicide.

- abstract: "This essay considers the utility of research questions that
    articulate aspects of transgender lives to the nontransgender
    populations with whom they share a wide range of bodily and lived
    experience. By foregrounding transgender's instability as a research
    variable, the authors argue for more precise methodological
    orientations in trans research, particularly regarding gender and
    sexual orientation. Drawing on their own data with trans men whose
    sexual attractions have shifted during transition, they argue
    against unidimensional interpretations of this experience. Feminists
    and critical race scholars suggest that race and gender frequently
    function as \"proxies\": variables that reduce the complexities of
    biosocial bodily experience to more quantifiable forms of data. The
    authors argue that much of the research conducted with transgender
    persons suffers from similar reductions, narrowing the
    epistemological frameworks through which these populations are
    subsequently investigated and understood. By contrasting the
    National Transgender Discrimination Survey's focus on the measurable
    experience of discrimination with research that makes broader claims
    regarding \"the transgender population,\" the essay invites
    researchers to develop a set of best practices that resemble those
    of feminist science studies scholars."

- abstract: Interpersonal, social, and structural stressors have been
    identified as key elements that explain health disparities between
    transgender and cisgender individuals. However, most of this
    research has focused on binary transgender individuals or has not
    differentiated between binary and nonbinary individuals; little
    research has examined the experiences of minority stress or health
    of those identifying outside the gender binary. Guided by
    intersectionality and drawing on a sample of 3,568 college students
    from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health's 2012−2016
    database---of whom 892 identified outside the gender binary---we
    conducted analyses of demographic and outcome measures administered
    in participants' 1st counseling appointment, examining differences
    between cisgender, transgender, and genderqueer individuals. We
    found that genderqueer individuals were harassed, sexually abused,
    and subjected to traumatic events at higher rates than were either
    cisgender or binary transgender individuals, with approximately 50%
    of genderqueer individuals reporting one of these experiences. We
    found that genderqueer individuals experienced more anxiety,
    depression, psychological distress, and eating concerns than did
    binary transgender and cisgender individuals and more social anxiety
    than did cisgender individuals. Genderqueer individuals more
    frequently reported self-harm and suicidality than did any other
    group, with approximately 2/3 of participants' having contemplated
    and nearly 50% making a suicide attempt. We extend current
    theorizing about minority stress (Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Meyer,
    2003) to include genderqueer individuals and delineate several
    structural aspects of genderqueer experiences that may be
    responsible for these trends, including others' lack of knowledge
    about genderqueer experiences and pronouns, poor access to legal and
    medical resources, and systemic discrimination. (PsycInfo Database

- abstract: This research investigates transgender individuals'
    experiences with misgendering---the misclassification of gender
    identity---from a minority stress perspective. Four hundred and ten
    transgender individuals (M = 30.27 years, 83.9% European American)
    participated in a survey in which they reported how frequently they
    are misgendered and how stigmatized they feel when it occurs in
    addition to protective factors (gender identity importance, social
    support) and psychological distress (anxiety, depression, stress,
    transgender felt stigma). On average, participants reported being
    misgendered sometimes (M = 3.05, SD = 1.18) and feeling somewhat
    stigmatized by these experiences (M = 3.64, SD = 1.30). Perceived
    frequency of misgendering and feeling stigmatized by these
    experiences were positively associated with identity importance, but
    only perceived frequency was negatively associated with social
    support. Both perceived frequency and feeling stigmatized were
    positively associated with psychological distress. In turn, identity
    importance and social support were positively associated with
    psychological distress. There was a significant interaction between
    felt stigma and identity importance in predicting depression and
    stress. There was a positive association between felt stigma and
    stress and depression at low and high levels of identity importance,
    but this association was stronger at low levels of identity
    importance. In addition, there was a significant interaction between
    perceived frequency of misgendering and social support such that the
    association between perceived frequency and felt stigma was positive
    at low levels of social support but not at high levels of social
    support. In conclusion, misgendering is likely a novel minority
    stressor for transgender people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019

- abstract: "This study describes stress as derived from minority status
    and explores its effect on psychological distress in gay men. The
    concept of minority stress is based on the premise that gay people
    in a heterosexist society are subjected to chronic stress related to
    their stigmatization. Minority stressors were conceptualized as:
    internalized homophobia, which relates to gay men's direction of
    societal negative attitudes toward the self; stigma, which relates
    to expectations of rejection and discrimination; and actual
    experiences of discrimination and violence. The mental health
    effects of the three minority stressors were tested in a community
    sample of 741 New York City gay men. The results supported minority
    stress hypotheses: each of the stressors had a significant
    independent association with a variety of mental health measures.
    Odds ratios suggested that men who had high levels of minority
    stress were twice to three times as likely to suffer also from high
    levels of distress."

- abstract: In this article the author reviews research evidence on the
    prevalence of mental disorders in lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals
    (LGBs) and shows, using meta-analyses, that LGBs have a higher
    prevalence of mental disorders than heterosexuals. The author offers
    a conceptual framework for understanding this excess in prevalence
    of disorder in terms of minority stress--explaining that stigma,
    prejudice, and discrimination create a hostile and stressful social
    environment that causes mental health problems. The model describes
    stress processes, including the experience of prejudice events,
    expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, internalized
    homophobia, and ameliorative coping processes. This conceptual
    framework is the basis for the review of research evidence,
    suggestions for future research directions, and exploration of
    public policy implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA,

- abstract: Research suggests that transgender people face high levels
    of discrimination in society, which may contribute to their
    disproportionate risk for poor health. However, little is known
    about whether gender nonconformity, as a visible marker of one's
    stigmatized status as a transgender individual, heightens trans
    people's experiences with discrimination and, in turn, their health.
    Using data from the largest survey of transgender adults in the
    United States, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N =
    4,115), we examine the associations among gender nonconformity,
    transphobic discrimination, and health-harming behaviors (i.e.,
    attempted suicide, drug/alcohol abuse, and smoking). The results
    suggest that gender nonconforming trans people face more
    discrimination and, in turn, are more likely to engage in
    health-harming behaviors than trans people who are gender
    conforming. Our findings highlight the important role of gender
    nonconformity in the social experiences and well-being of
    transgender people.

- abstract: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth experience high rates
    of victimization leading to health disparities. Community size and
    community climate are associated with health outcomes among SGM
    youth; however, we lack studies that include them as covariates
    alongside victimization to understand their collective impact on
    health. This study utilized minority stress theory to understand how
    community context shapes experiences of victimization and health
    among SGM youth. SGM youth in one Midwestern U.S. state completed an
    online survey (n = 201) with measures of physical health, mental
    health, community context, and victimization. Data were analyzed via
    multiple regression using a path analysis framework. Results
    indicate that perceived climate was associated with mental, but not
    physical, health; Community size was unrelated to health outcomes.
    Victimization mediated the association between community climate and
    mental health. Findings are discussed in light of current literature
    and implications for research and practice are shared.

- abstract: "This study assessed individual (ie, internalized
    transphobia) and structural forms of stigma as risk factors for
    suicide attempts among transgender adults. Internalized transphobia
    was assessed through a 26-item scale including four dimensions:
    pride, passing, alienation, and shame. State-level structural stigma
    was operationalized as a composite index, including density of
    same-sex couples; proportion of Gay--Straight Alliances per public
    high school; 5 policies related to sexual orientation
    discrimination; and aggregated public opinion toward homosexuality.
    Multivariable logistic generalized estimating equation models
    assessed associations of interest among an online sample of
    transgender adults (N = 1,229) representing 48 states and the
    District of Columbia. Lower levels of structural stigma were
    associated with fewer lifetime suicide attempts (AOR 0.96, 95% CI
    0.92--0.997), and a higher score on the internalized transphobia
    scale was associated with greater lifetime suicide attempts (AOR
    1.18, 95% CI 1.04--1.33). Addressing stigma at multiple levels is
    necessary to reduce the vulnerability of suicide attempts among
    transgender adults."

- abstract: "Purpose: Transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC)
    individuals often are the target of enacted or external (i.e.,
    distal) experiences of stigma, discrimination, and violence, which
    are linked to adverse health, particularly psychological distress.
    There is limited research, however, examining felt or internal
    (i.e., proximal) stressors faced by TGNC individuals. This study
    sought to examine one type of internal stressor, expecting
    rejection, and aimed to (1) identify how and to what extent
    rejection expectations operate day-to-day for TGNC individuals and
    (2) explore how TGNC individuals respond to expectations of
    rejection.Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 30
    participants from 2014 to 2015 who identified as TGNC (mean
    age=30.4; 60% people of color); data were analyzed using a
    consensual qualitative research method.Results: Four thematic
    categories emerged about expecting rejection: (1) where to expect
    rejection; (2) thoughts and feelings associated with expectations of
    rejection; (3) coping strategies used to manage the expectation of
    rejection; and (4) the intersection of race and ethnicity with
    rejection expectations.Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest
    that expecting rejection is a frequent and salient internal stressor
    for TGNC individuals. We discuss the psychological and cumulative
    potential health impact of minority stress, and the applicability of
    Meyer's Minority Stress Model. Therapeutic interventions are needed
    to address the specific cognitive, emotional, and behavioral
    responses TGNC individuals experience as a result of the stress
    associated with expecting rejection, including fear, anxiety, and
    situational avoidance."

- abstract: Research examining risk and resilience among transgender
    individuals suggests that connection to a transgender community may
    be protective. Utilizing archival survey data of 3,087 adult
    transgender participants collected in 2005--06, this study further
    evaluated how awareness and engagement with other transgender people
    influences risk and resilience during early gender identity
    development. As hypothesized, among male-to-female and
    female-to-male respondents, both prior awareness and prior
    engagement with other transgender people were independently related
    to less fearfulness, less suicidality, and more comfort. These
    relationships were not significant among male-to-different-gender or
    female-to-different-gender participants. Implications of these
    findings are discussed.

- abstract: Although research has consistently shown that individuals
    who identify as transgender have increased rates of mental health
    difficulties compared to their cisgender peers, less is known about
    the psychological mechanisms that convey this heightened risk. The
    data analyzed here were collected through the Wake Forest Well Being
    Assessment, which was conducted at 28 U.S. colleges and
    universities. The sample included 372 transgender college students
    who completed measures of discrimination, belonging, loneliness,
    depression, and anxiety. The results demonstrated an indirect
    association such that participants who reported more domains of
    discrimination reported lower belonging, which was associated with
    greater loneliness, which was associated with greater depression and
    anxiety. Ultimately, the findings of the present study provided
    further support of the psychological mediation model and can be used
    to inform interventions.

- abstract: Research shows that LGBTQ communities experience high levels
    of suicidality and mental ill health. They also face significant
    barriers to accessing adequate mental health treatment in service
    settings. In response to these factors, it is likely that LGBTQ
    community members turn to their peers for informal mental
    health-related support. Such support, however, is largely undefined,
    the extent of it poorly understood and its impacts on those who
    perform it underexplored.
