	abstract = {The institutionalization of transgender studies as a field comes just as the academy has decided that “fields” are a less relevant and more cumbersome aspect of professional academic organization that prevents the kind of theoretical and empirical work needed to make scholarship relevant to contemporary society. A number of areas of intellectual inquiry have, accordingly, shifted to a “post-discipline” model of academic organization. But what would it mean to think of transgender studies as a post-discipline? First, it would mean a turn away from a focus on field-building within the humanities. Second, it would mean insisting upon transdisciplinary collaboration despite the academy’s failure to encourage such collaboration. But perhaps most importantly, it would mean a turn *toward* addressing the material conditions of transgender existence and the issues transgender people face in the world. In short, it would mean reorienting ourselves toward an *applied transgender studies*.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the immediate travesti critique of the Argentine Gender Identity Law (law 26,743) in May 2012. Based on what was developed by Marlene Wayar, as an example of sudaca criticism and internal blasphemy, the travesti critique points out that the law does not recognize the specificity of the transvestite identity or its patent inequality, and it reintroduces the binary man/woman categories because it is capable of sanctioning only on the basis of a general population and within a liberal framework of state recognition. In this article the travesti critique of the Gender Identity Law is taken up to indicate a terrain of interrogations and challenges where the law becomes an instance of politicization, that is, where it becomes a field of strategic action and agency, but also a social tool and an instance of resistance, rejoinder, and reply.},

	abstract = {Questions of time and chronology have risen to the forefront of scholarship in queer and trans studies in recent years.1 Carolyn Dinshaw has advocated for anachronistic “touches” across time, Roderick Ferguson has envisioned queer “palimpsests with residues of earlier discourses and histories,” and C. Riley Snorton has highlighted intersections of blackness and trans as a condition of temporal possibility—as “movement with no clear origin and no point of arrival” (Dinshaw 1999; Dinshaw et al. 2007: 180; Snorton 2017: 2). Beyond this, a wave of new conferences and publications has explored “trans temporalities,” further demonstrating how methods of accounting for and thinking through time have become increasingly relevant to scholarship on trans subjects (e.g., Lau 2016; Fisher, Phillips, and Katri 2017).2 In an influential essay, Kadji Amin has welcomed this “critical focus on the temporal underpinnings of transgender as a historical category [which] . . . may open the way toward a more transformative politics of justice” (2014: 219). It is to this crux of temporality and temporal crossing—always linked to overlapping modes of history, historiography, and historicity—that our issue of TSQ speaks. “Trans*historicities” joins surging interest in gender and sexuality as they relate to both patterns of time and the writing of history, advancing critical trans politics while simultaneously articulating and confounding our investments in reading, engaging, and cocreating historical pasts.},

	abstract = {This special issue began with a simple provocation: “Where do we find the transvestite and the transsexual?” The ascendance and mainstreaming of transgender and its offshoots in its Anglo-American idiom represent more than a shift in nomenclature. While transsexual and transvestite were central categories that organized trans experience across a wide array of geographies, genders, and racial and class coordinates during the twentieth century, these categories have receded into the background of anglophone activism and academia. Trans studies, which has been dominated by US and English-based scholarship, has largely moved on from transsexuals in favor of ostensibly more open-ended and proliferating models of gender variance. Transvestites, for their part, have never occupied the center of the field of trans studies. Rendered anachronistic, both groups are more vulnerable than ever to long-standing stigmas with a new temporal twist. They are viewed as either tragic figures who could never be their “true” selves, in the case of transvestites, or hyper gender-conforming figures limited by the time in which they lived, in the case of transsexuals; the forward march of transgender has buried the fact that there are many living people who still identify with and live under those signs.},

	abstract = {How should we interrogate and oppose the current anti-gender misappropriation of postcolonial thought and struggles? Recently, we have seen a resurgence of organized anti-gender sentiments across Europe and the globe. A specific anti-gender rhetoric of victimization defines so-called Western genderists as a common enemy and colonizing force against “the people.” By focusing on some key European anti-gender actors, this article analyzes the strategic significance of the specific anti-gender assertion that gender is a neocolonial imposition. Beyond examining how the European anti-gender takeover of postcolonial framing is hypocritical—as anti-gender thinkers are themselves invested in the cisheterosexist myth that is perhaps the most colonial of all—the article argues that the misappropriation reveals something central about the racialized imaginary underpinning their rhetoric. They reproduce a racialized hierarchy of biological plasticity that positions white Europeans as both the ultimate saviors and the most vulnerable victims in the face of “genderism.” By unpacking the politics through which European anti-gender actors use the “non-Western” world as a rhetorical ruse to further Western supremacy, the article also shows the danger of the impulse to suspend postcolonial feminist critique in an effort to distance oneself from the anti-gender misappropriation of such theory and to unite around a common liberal front. Instead, it proposes that postcolonial thought is more vital than ever if we are to counter current anti-gender movements, their Islamophobia, and their transphobia.},

	abstract = {In this article, the author argues that a decolonial perspective on gender means conceptualizing it as always already trans. The object of investigation is gender as a category and gender studies as a field of knowledge. To discuss what decolonizing trans/gender studies in Europe could mean, the author aims to bring different strands together that have been held apart so far: resistance against global attacks on gender studies, resistance against transphobic feminism, and the “decolonising the curriculum” movement in the United Kingdom. A critical focus on Eurocentric knowledge and truth claims means to define Europe as a complex set of geopolitical, historical, and epistemological processes and not just as a neutral location. At British universities, a mostly student-led movement has started to emerge that fights for decolonizing higher education. This movement is inspired by transnational student movements like Rhodes/Fees Must Fall in South Africa and calls for challenging racist, colonialist, nationalist, and neoliberal paradigms in knowledge production by addressing both issues of epistemology and access to higher education. Applying central political claims of the “decolonising the curriculum” movement, the author explores potentials and challenges of the task of decolonizing trans/gender studies in Europe and the global North. The author's intervention opens up a discussion on how to conceptualize knowledge on transgender with a central focus on decolonial and transnational perspectives.},
