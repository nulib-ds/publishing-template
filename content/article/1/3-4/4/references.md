- abstract: The institutionalization of transgender studies as a field
    comes just as the academy has decided that "fields" are a less
    relevant and more cumbersome aspect of professional academic
    organization that prevents the kind of theoretical and empirical
    work needed to make scholarship relevant to contemporary society. A
    number of areas of intellectual inquiry have, accordingly, shifted
    to a "post-discipline" model of academic organization. But what
    would it mean to think of transgender studies as a post-discipline?
    First, it would mean a turn away from a focus on field-building
    within the humanities. Second, it would mean insisting upon
    transdisciplinary collaboration despite the academy's failure to
    encourage such collaboration. But perhaps most importantly, it would
    mean a turn \*toward\* addressing the material conditions of
    transgender existence and the issues transgender people face in the
    world. In short, it would mean reorienting ourselves toward an
    \*applied transgender studies\*.

- abstract: This article reviews the immediate travesti critique of the
    Argentine Gender Identity Law (law 26,743) in May 2012. Based on
    what was developed by Marlene Wayar, as an example of sudaca
    criticism and internal blasphemy, the travesti critique points out
    that the law does not recognize the specificity of the transvestite
    identity or its patent inequality, and it reintroduces the binary
    man/woman categories because it is capable of sanctioning only on
    the basis of a general population and within a liberal framework of
    state recognition. In this article the travesti critique of the
    Gender Identity Law is taken up to indicate a terrain of
    interrogations and challenges where the law becomes an instance of
    politicization, that is, where it becomes a field of strategic
    action and agency, but also a social tool and an instance of
    resistance, rejoinder, and reply.

- abstract: "Questions of time and chronology have risen to the
    forefront of scholarship in queer and trans studies in recent
    years.1 Carolyn Dinshaw has advocated for anachronistic \"touches\"
    across time, Roderick Ferguson has envisioned queer \"palimpsests
    with residues of earlier discourses and histories,\" and C. Riley
    Snorton has highlighted intersections of blackness and trans as a
    condition of temporal possibility---as \"movement with no clear
    origin and no point of arrival\" (Dinshaw 1999; Dinshaw et al. 2007:
    180; Snorton 2017: 2). Beyond this, a wave of new conferences and
    publications has explored \"trans temporalities,\" further
    demonstrating how methods of accounting for and thinking through
    time have become increasingly relevant to scholarship on trans
    subjects (e.g., Lau 2016; Fisher, Phillips, and Katri 2017).2 In an
    influential essay, Kadji Amin has welcomed this \"critical focus on
    the temporal underpinnings of transgender as a historical category
    \\[which\\] . . . may open the way toward a more transformative
    politics of justice\" (2014: 219). It is to this crux of temporality
    and temporal crossing---always linked to overlapping modes of
    history, historiography, and historicity---that our issue of TSQ
    speaks. \"Trans\\*historicities\" joins surging interest in gender and
    sexuality as they relate to both patterns of time and the writing of
    history, advancing critical trans politics while simultaneously
    articulating and confounding our investments in reading, engaging,
    and cocreating historical pasts."

- abstract: "This special issue began with a simple provocation: \"Where
    do we find the transvestite and the transsexual?\" The ascendance and
    mainstreaming of transgender and its offshoots in its Anglo-American
    idiom represent more than a shift in nomenclature. While transsexual
    and transvestite were central categories that organized trans
    experience across a wide array of geographies, genders, and racial
    and class coordinates during the twentieth century, these categories
    have receded into the background of anglophone activism and
    academia. Trans studies, which has been dominated by US and
    English-based scholarship, has largely moved on from transsexuals in
    favor of ostensibly more open-ended and proliferating models of
    gender variance. Transvestites, for their part, have never occupied
    the center of the field of trans studies. Rendered anachronistic,
    both groups are more vulnerable than ever to long-standing stigmas
    with a new temporal twist. They are viewed as either tragic figures
    who could never be their \"true\" selves, in the case of
    transvestites, or hyper gender-conforming figures limited by the
    time in which they lived, in the case of transsexuals; the forward
    march of transgender has buried the fact that there are many living
    people who still identify with and live under those signs."

- abstract: How should we interrogate and oppose the current anti-gender
    misappropriation of postcolonial thought and struggles? Recently, we
    have seen a resurgence of organized anti-gender sentiments across
    Europe and the globe. A specific anti-gender rhetoric of
    victimization defines so-called Western genderists as a common enemy
    and colonizing force against "the people." By focusing on some key
    European anti-gender actors, this article analyzes the strategic
    significance of the specific anti-gender assertion that gender is a
    neocolonial imposition. Beyond examining how the European
    anti-gender takeover of postcolonial framing is hypocritical---as
    anti-gender thinkers are themselves invested in the cisheterosexist
    myth that is perhaps the most colonial of all---the article argues
    that the misappropriation reveals something central about the
    racialized imaginary underpinning their rhetoric. They reproduce a
    racialized hierarchy of biological plasticity that positions white
    Europeans as both the ultimate saviors and the most vulnerable
    victims in the face of "genderism." By unpacking the politics
    through which European anti-gender actors use the "non-Western"
    world as a rhetorical ruse to further Western supremacy, the article
    also shows the danger of the impulse to suspend postcolonial
    feminist critique in an effort to distance oneself from the
    anti-gender misappropriation of such theory and to unite around a
    common liberal front. Instead, it proposes that postcolonial thought
    is more vital than ever if we are to counter current anti-gender
    movements, their Islamophobia, and their transphobia.

- abstract: "In this article, the author argues that a decolonial
    perspective on gender means conceptualizing it as always already
    trans. The object of investigation is gender as a category and
    gender studies as a field of knowledge. To discuss what decolonizing
    trans/gender studies in Europe could mean, the author aims to bring
    different strands together that have been held apart so far:
    resistance against global attacks on gender studies, resistance
    against transphobic feminism, and the \"decolonising the curriculum\"
    movement in the United Kingdom. A critical focus on Eurocentric
    knowledge and truth claims means to define Europe as a complex set
    of geopolitical, historical, and epistemological processes and not
    just as a neutral location. At British universities, a mostly
    student-led movement has started to emerge that fights for
    decolonizing higher education. This movement is inspired by
    transnational student movements like Rhodes/Fees Must Fall in South
    Africa and calls for challenging racist, colonialist, nationalist,
    and neoliberal paradigms in knowledge production by addressing both
    issues of epistemology and access to higher education. Applying
    central political claims of the \"decolonising the curriculum\"
    movement, the author explores potentials and challenges of the task
    of decolonizing trans/gender studies in Europe and the global North.
    The author's intervention opens up a discussion on how to
    conceptualize knowledge on transgender with a central focus on
    decolonial and transnational perspectives."
