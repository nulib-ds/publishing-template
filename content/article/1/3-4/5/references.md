- abstract: In this article, we discuss the theoretical implications of
    empirical elaborations of Bernstein's (1997) model of identity
    deployment. New research encompasses a diverse array of venues and
    targets and elaborates on the mechanisms through which identities
    may be deployed strategically. Application of the identity
    deployment model spans a variety of so-called 'identity movements'
    as well as ethnic, nationalist and indigenous movements, and
    community mobilization. Identity deployment is also a useful
    strategy in organizational and professional contexts, as in the
    micro-brewery movement or culinary movements, demonstrating the
    theoretical generalizability of the original model. New research
    closely examines the relationship between identity and strategy and
    the conditions that affect activists' choice of identity strategies
    as well as the situations where they might avoid identity strategies
    altogether. Research finds that identities may be deployed
    performatively, rhetorically or discursively. Identity deployment
    may be facilitated by emotional displays, music and ritual. The way
    that power and authority are organized in a given venue determines
    in part the capacity of activists and organizations to alternate
    between celebrating and suppressing difference from the majority.
    Identity deployment influences internal and external outcomes,
    affecting mobilization and goal achievement. Finally, feedback loops
    link the different analytic dimensions of identity.

- abstract: "In the late 1980s, after a decade spent engaged in more
    routine interest-group politics, thousands of lesbians and gay men
    responded to the AIDS crisis by defiantly and dramatically taking to
    the streets. But by the early 1990s, the organization they founded,
    ACT UP, was no more---even as the AIDS epidemic raged on. Weaving
    together interviews with activists, extensive research, and
    reflections on the author's time as a member of the organization,
    Moving Politics is the first book to chronicle the rise and fall of
    ACT UP, highlighting a key factor in its trajectory:
    emotion.Surprisingly overlooked by many scholars of social
    movements, emotion, Gould argues, plays a fundamental role in
    political activism. From anger to hope, pride to shame, and
    solidarity to despair, feelings played a significant part in ACT
    UP's provocative style of protest, which included raucous
    demonstrations, die-ins, and other kinds of street theater.
    Detailing the movement's public triumphs and private setbacks,
    Moving Politics is the definitive account of ACT UP's origin,
    development, and decline as well as a searching look at the role of
    emotion in contentious politics."

    oppositional, as are those who join change movements. This volume
    offers new scholarship that explores how people negotiate identity
