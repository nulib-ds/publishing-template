- abstract: "The purpose of this review is to create a set of
    provisional criteria for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) to refer
    to when assessing the ethical orientation of transgender health
    research proposals. We began by searching for literature on this
    topic using databases and the reference lists of key articles,
    resulting in a preliminary set of criteria. We then collaborated to
    develop the following nine guidelines: (1) Whenever possible,
    research should be grounded, from inception to dissemination, in a
    meaningful collaboration with community stakeholders; (2) language
    and framing of transgender health research should be
    non-stigmatizing; (3) research should be disseminated back to the
    community; (4) the diversity of the transgender and gender diverse
    (TGGD) community should be accurately reflected and sensitively
    reflected; (5) informed consent must be meaningful, without coercion
    or undue influence; (6) the protection of participant
    confidentiality should be paramount; (7) alternative consent
    procedures should be considered for TGGD minors; (8) research should
    align with current professional standards that refute conversion,
    reorientation, or reparative therapy; and (9) IRBs should guard
    against the temptation to avoid, limit, or delay research on this
    subject."

- abstract: We assessed whether recent psychological literature on
    children reflects or contrasts with the zeitgeist of American
    Psychological Association's recent non-discrimination statement on
    'transgender' and 'gender variant' individuals. Article records (N =
    94) on childhood 'gender identity' and 'expression' published
    between 1999 and 2008 inclusive were evaluated for two kinds of
    cisgenderism, the ideology that invalidates or pathologises
    self-designated genders that contrast with external designations.
    Misgendering language contradicts children's own gender assignations
    and was less frequent than pathologising language which constructs
    children's own gender assignations and expression as disordered.
    Articles on children's gender identity/expression are increasingly
    impactful within psychology. Cisgenderism is neither increasing nor
    decreasing overall. Mental health professionals are more
    cisgenderist than other authors. Articles by members of an
    'invisible college' structured around the most prolific author in
    this area are more cisgenderist and impactful than other articles.
    We suggest how authors and editors can implement American
    Psychological Association policy and change scientific discourse
    about children's genders.

- abstract: How to account for participants' psychological and emotional
    exhaustion with research has been under-explored in the research
    ethics literature. Research fatigue, as it is known, has significant
    impacts on patients' well-being and their ongoing and future
    participation in studies. From the perspective of researchers and
    researched communities, research fatigue also creates selection bias
    and opportunity costs, negatively impacting the collective
    scientific enterprise. Institutional Review Boards should
    systematically consider research fatigue during the research
    approval process and strive to mitigate it.

- abstract: "Given that an estimated 0.6% of the U.S. population is
    transgender (trans) and that large health disparities for this
    population have been documented, government and research
    organizations are increasingly expanding measures of sex/gender to
    be trans inclusive. Options suggested for trans community surveys,
    such as expansive check-all-that-apply gender identity lists and
    write-in options that offer maximum flexibility, are generally not
    appropriate for broad population surveys. These require limited
    questions and a small number of categories for analysis. Limited
    evaluation has been undertaken of trans-inclusive population survey
    measures for sex/gender, including those currently in use. Using an
    internet survey and follow-up of 311 participants, and cognitive
    interviews from a maximum-diversity sub-sample (n = 79), we
    conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of two existing measures: a
    two-step question developed in the United States and a
    multidimensional measure developed in Canada. We found very low
    levels of item missingness, and no indicators of confusion on the
    part of cisgender (non-trans) participants for both measures.
    However, a majority of interview participants indicated problems
    with each question item set. Agreement between the two measures in
    assessment of gender identity was very high (K = 0.9081), but gender
    identity was a poor proxy for other dimensions of sex or gender
    among trans participants. Issues to inform measure development or
    adaptation that emerged from analysis included dimensions of
    sex/gender measured, whether non-binary identities were trans,
    Indigenous and cultural identities, proxy reporting, temporality
    concerns, and the inability of a single item to provide a valid
    measure of sex/gender. Based on this evaluation, we recommend that
    population surveys meant for multi-purpose analysis consider a new
    Multidimensional Sex/Gender Measure for testing that includes three
    simple items (one asked only of a small sub-group) to assess gender
    identity and lived gender, with optional additions. We provide
    considerations for adaptation of this measure to different
    contexts."

- abstract: "For people who are transgender, transsexual, or
    transitioned (trans), access to primary, emergency, and
    transition-related health care is often problematic. Results from
    Phase I of the Trans PULSE Project, a community-based research
    project in Ontario, Canada, are presented. Based on qualitative data
    from focus groups with 85 trans community members, a theoretical
    framework describing how erasure functions to impact experiences
    interacting with the health care system was developed. Two key sites
    of erasure were identified: informational erasure and institutional
    erasure. How these processes work in a mutually reinforcing manner
    to erase trans individuals and communities and produce a system in
    which a trans patient or client is seen as an anomaly is shown.
    Thus, the impetus often falls on trans individuals to attempt to
    remedy systematic deficiencies. The concept of cisnormativity is
    introduced to aid in explaining the pervasiveness of trans erasure.
    Strategies for change are identified."

- abstract: "Critiques of gender/sex measurement tend to focus on the
    questions researchers ask, including their binaristic, static
    nature, or overfocus on/erasure of transgender/cisgender status. The
    questions matter, as does the way gender/sex responses may be
    categorized, which has received less focus. In this article, we
    report on the \"Gender/Sex 3×3,\" which we developed via two studies
    to produce a novel framework for conceptualizing, measuring, and
    categorizing gender/sex. It represents two intersecting dimensions:
    \"gender trajectory\" (cisgender/transgender/allogender \\[i.e.,
    neither cisgender nor transgender\\]) and \"binary relation\"
    (binary/nonbinary/allobinary \\[i.e., neither binary nor
    nonbinary\\]). In Study 1, we created gender/sex questions structured
    by the Gender/Sex 3×3 and asked 737 gender/sex-diverse participants
    to directly evaluate them. Descriptive quantitative feedback
    indicated the comprehensibility and inclusivity of the questions;
    qualitative feedback suggested wording changes. In Study 2, we
    tested these revised questions with 317 gender/sex-diverse
    participants and again found high levels of comprehensibility and
    inclusivity. We conclude by providing recommendations for questions
    about gender/sex that are inclusive of all nine locations in the
    Gender/Sex 3×3 and useful for flexible categorizations of
    gender/sexes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights

- abstract: This article examines the role of city twinning as a device
    for conducting transnational activism around lesbian, gay, bisexual,
    transgender and queer (LGBTQ) politics. It focuses on the city of
    Leiden in the Netherlands, examining how the city's twinning links
    with the cities of Torun in Poland and Oxford in the UK have been
    used at different times as a device to mobilize transnational
    solidarities with LGBTQ people outside of the Netherlands. Drawing
    on qualitative semi-structured interviews with LGBTQ activists in
    Leiden as part of a wider study of transnational LGBTQ activism in
    Europe, I seek to understand how twinning links are used to forge
    sustainable solidarities both across national boundaries and within
    Leiden. I suggest that relational comparisons about the status and
    treatment of sexual dissidents in Leiden and its twin cities are
    central to the production of these solidarities. While twinning has
    significant potential as a device for the production of sustainable
    transnational LGBTQ activism, I also suggest that it can be used to
    advance problematic geo-temporalities about the relative
    'progressiveness' or 'backwardness' of LGBTQ politics in specific
    cities.

- abstract: Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research has
    expanded nationally and internationally over the last decade, and
    recently there has been significant attention given to understanding
    its impact on research. Less attention has been given to the impact
    of PPI on the people involved, yet it has been shown that the
    success of PPI in research can be reliant on the processes of
    engagement between these individuals and communities. This paper
    therefore critically explores the impact of PPI on service users,
    researchers and communities involved in health and social care
    research.

- abstract: As U.S. society has become more aware of gender identity
    issues, there has been a push for more inclusive demographic
    categories that go beyond the traditional gender binary of
    male/female. In three studies, we assessed the attitudes of U.S.
    cisgender men and women across sexual orientations (Study 1),
    heterosexual cisgender men and women (Study 2), cisgender LGB men
    and women (Study 3), and transgender and gender non-binary
    individuals across sexual orientations (Study 3) regarding different
    formats of gender questionnaires. Studies 2 and 3 showed a strong
    overall preference for the non-binary formats. Across all three
    studies, preferences for the binary format and objections to the
    non-binary formats were related to gender-binary beliefs,
    distinctiveness threat, cisgender and mostly heterosexual male
    participants, conservative political orientation, and religiosity.
    These findings suggest that general opposition to utilizing
    non-binary formats may be influenced by institutionalized binary
    gender norms and heteronormativity. Across both cisgender and
    gender-diverse samples, most participants preferred a non-binary
    gender question format, and gender-diverse individuals
    overwhelmingly preferred the expanded format. We suggest that those

- abstract: Neovaginal prolapse is a rare and distressing complication
    after male-to-female sexual reassignment surgery. We retrospectively
    analysed the prevalence of partial and total neo-vaginal prolapses
    after sexual reassignment surgery in our institute. During the
    years, two different techniques have been adopted with the aim of
    fixing the neovaginal cylinder. In the first, two absorbable sutures
    are placed at the top of the penoscrotal cylinder and fixed to the
    Denonvilliers fascia. In the second, two additional sutures are
    added from the posterior/midpoint of the flap to the prerectal
    fascia. We enrolled 282 consecutive transsexual patients. 65
    (23.04%) out of the 282 were treated with the first technique and
    the following 217 (76.96%) with the last technique. In the first
    technique, 1 case (1.53%) of total prolapse and 7 cases (10.76%) of
    partial prolapse were observed, while in the other 217 patients
    treated with the second technique only 9 cases of partial prolapse
    were observed (4.14%) and no cases of total prolapse. All prolapses
    occurred within 6 months from the procedure. In our experience, the
    use of 4 stitches and a more proximal positioning of the sutures to
    fix the penoscrotal apex with the Denonvilliers fascia guarantees a
    lower risk of prolapse.

- abstract: "Empirical evidence affirms that gender is a nonbinary
    spectrum. Yet our review of recently published empirical articles
    reveals that demographic gender measurement in psychology still
    assumes that gender comprises just two categories: women and men.
    This common practice is problematic. It fails to represent
    psychologists' current understanding of gender, violates our ethical
    principles as scientists, and can result in gender
    misclassification. Psychologists' reliance on binary measures also
    conveys an exclusionary attitude that is contrary to recent ethical
    recommendations and contrary to the growing public concern about
    transgender rights. We extend five simple, no-cost recommendations
    that begin to resolve these ethical and methodological problems: use
    and report, nonbinary gender measures; report the prevalence of
    nonbinary participants; clarify their inclusion and treatment in
    analysis; and use gender inclusive language. We also address common
    concerns expressed by researchers, including whether measuring \"sex\"
    resolves the issue and whether gender-inclusive measures confuse or
    offend participants."

- abstract: This article focuses on transmasculine mixed-race Asian
    American filmmaker Christopher Lee's documentaries and pornography
    of the 1990s. At a moment before today's reduction of transgender
    experiences to spectacles of transitional assimilation, bio-social
    disorder, and death by dominant---or even authoritarian---white
    cis-heteropatriarchal culture, Lee's films gave expression to the
    gender subversions of trans people of colour and their
    co-conspirators. In solidarity with Lee's work, I produce critical
    creative language about racial transgender social identities. At a
    current moment offering more abundant critical resources and
    intersectional transgender movement-building, I also seek to
    re-harness Lee's transmasculine imagery towards the trans of colour
    feminist work of transforming the white Western cis-binary
    gender/sex system and its perceptual structures. I view the
    communities represented in Lee's filmmaking as confronting the
    contradictions of a post-Civil Rights neoliberal multiculturalism
    that promises minimal access while institutionalizing white
    cis-binary formations of gender/sex fundamental to the US
    nation-state.

- abstract: The case of a 39-year-old male-to-female transgender patient
    who underwent feminization of his masculine forehead is presented.
    Surgical techniques to feminize his forehead were as follows. The
    outer table of the frontal sinus was removed and divided into four
    pieces with an oscillation saw. These pieces were reshaped,
    regrafted, and fixed back along with two microplates. The bilateral
    supraorbital ridges were shaved with a surgical bur. Brow lifting
    and lowering of the frontolateral hairline were performed
    simultaneously. There were no complications during the 1-year
    follow-up. The patient is satisfied with the more feminine forehead.

    based on participants' identities as \"mad,\" sexual assault
    survivors, and/or LGBTQ. Conclusions and Implications for Practice:
    While a medicalized interpretation of \"recovery\" may not work for
    some women, alternative understandings, such as using \"recovery\" to
    heal from discrimination and demand systemic changes, have
    liberatory potential. It is essential that supporters discern and
    utilize each woman's chosen language. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

- abstract: In this article, I argue that collaborative photography
    offers dynamic potential for imag(in)ing trans intimate partnerships
    beyond the authority of textual representation. I present five
    photographic and narrative case studies, spanning a range of trans
    partnerships in the UK, to demonstrate some of the complex ways in
    which bodies, genders, sexualities, and time intersect in trans
    intimacy. I argue that the photographs create an imaginative
    resource, both for the people depicted in the photographs and for
    those viewing the photographs, providing new possibilities for
    thinking about trans partnerships, expanding the ways in which trans
    intimate partnerships are imag(in)ed, and opening up new spaces of
    possibility for gender and sexual identities.

    binary gender measurement practices. This study seeks to broaden
    current discourse on gender identity measurement in the USA,
    including measurement adoption challenges and mitigation strategies,
    thereby allowing for better data collection to understand and
    address health disparities for people of all genders. Three data
    sources were used to triangulate findings: expert interviews with
    gender and sexuality research leaders; key-informant interviews with
    gender minorities in New Orleans, LA; and document analysis of
    relevant surveys, guides and commentaries. Ten key dilemmas were
    identified: 1) moving beyond binary gender construction; 2)
    conflation of gender, sex and sexual orientation; 3) emerging nature
    of gender-related language; 4) concerns about item sensitivity; 5)
    research fatigue among gender minorities; 6) design and analytical
    limitations; 7) categorical and procedural consistency; 8)
    pre-populated vs. open-field survey items; 9) potential
    misclassification; and 10) competing data collection needs.
    Researchers must continue working toward consensus concerning better
    practices is gender measurement and be explicit about their
    methodological choices. The existence of these dilemmas must not
    impede research on important health issues affecting gender
    minorities."

    principles to guide ethical research within their respective
    communities. Thorough cataloging and description of these would
    inform university research ethics boards, researchers, and scholars
    and facilitate meaningful research that respects Indigenous-defined
    ethical values. A scoping study was conducted of all relevant
    peer-reviewed literature and public-facing Indigenous research
    ethical guidelines from First Nations, Metis, and Inuit communities
    and organizations in Canada. A total of 20 different Indigenous
    research ethics boards, frameworks, and protocols were identified.
    Analysis resulted in three key themes: (1) balancing individual and
    collective rights; (2) upholding culturally-grounded ethical
    principles; and (3) ensuring community-driven/self-determined
    research. Findings demonstrate how employment of Indigenous ethical
    principles in research positively contributes to research outcomes."

- abstract: Medical mistrust persists and appears to be growing. The
    public health literature on medical mistrust has largely focused on
    mistrust among Black and African American populations due to
    legacies of abuse and mistreatment, such as the infamous Tuskegee
    Syphilis Study. However, research is now emerging that explores
    mistrust among various populations and in varying contexts, and the
    literature now largely emphasizes the role of ongoing, present-day
    social and economic inequalities in shaping and sustaining mistrust,
    particularly among populations who experience staggering health
    disparities. This special issue showcased nine articles exploring
    medical mistrust among diverse populations, exploring a wide array
    of topics and spanning myriad methodologies. In addition to a
    rigorous systematic review of the literature, this issue covers
    several critical subareas of the health disparities literature,
    including preventative health screenings among Black men,
    discrimination and cultural factors among rural Latinx communities,
    health care satisfaction among Latina immigrant women, the complex
    relationship between HIV testing and "conspiracy beliefs" among
    Black populations, pre-exposure prophylaxis use among transgender
    women, the impacts of mass incarceration on HIV care, eHealth
    interventions to address chronic diseases among sexual minority men
    of color, and participatory research to engage underserved
    populations as co-researchers. The purpose of this article is to
    provide a brief summary of the nine manuscripts in this special
    issue and to outline some recommendations and future directions for
    research on medical mistrust.

- abstract: While trans identities are typically understood through the
    distress-based concept of \*gender dysphoria\*, some trans people
    use the term \*gender euphoria\* to describe their experiences.
    Broadly defined as positive gender-related emotions, the concept has
    become more common in trans communities in recent years but has
    received little academic attention. To fill this gap, we conducted
    qualitative interviews with five trans individuals. We found that
    gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from
    affirmation of one's gender identity or expression and can include a
    wide variety of emotions and experiences. Gender euphoria can range
    from feelings of intense joy accompanying the attainment of
    milestones in gender transition through to a more consistent sense
    of calmness and relief occurring later in transition. We
    contextualize these findings within the gender minority stress model
    to explore the link between gender euphoria, dysphoria, and health
    and well-being generally. Our findings emphasize the value of
    prioritizing euphoria, happiness, and safety in gender-affirming
    care.

- abstract: According to the 'Consolidated Guidelines on HIV Prevention,
    Diagnosis, Treatment and Care for Key Populations' there are five
    groups of people at elevated risk of HIV, including 'transgender
    women or transgender men who have receptive anal sex with men'.
    Although cost effectiveness strategies and best practice lessons
    recommend targeting specific populations for HIV prevention,
    existing risk categories lack specificity, and may in fact cause
    further confusion. Existing categories of risk often perpetuate
    notions of gender and sexuality that can erroneously exclude,
    alienate, and stigmatise those who are at the highest risk and thus
    should be prioritised. We review the troubled history of the MSM
    category and the problematic conflation of trans feminine
    individuals and MSM in much of the existing HIV literature, and how
    this practice has stymied progress in slowing the HIV epidemic in
    the most at-risk groups, including those who do not fit neatly into
    binary notions of gender and sex. We draw from examples in the
    field, specifically among trans feminine people in Beirut and San
    Francisco, to illustrate the lived experiences of individuals whose
    identities may not fit into Euro-Atlantic constructs of HIV
    prevention categories.

- abstract: "In this article, I consider the harms inflicted upon
    transgender persons through \"misgendering,\" that is, such
    deployments of gender terms that diminish transgender persons'
    self‐respect, limit the discursive resources at their disposal to
    define their own gender, and cause them microaggressive
    psychological harms. Such deployments are morally contestable, that
    is, they can be challenged on ethical or political grounds. Two
    characterizations of \"woman\" proposed in the feminist literature are
    critiqued from this perspective. When we consider what would happen
    to transgender women upon the broad implementation of these
    characterizations within transgender women's social context, we
    discover that they suffer from two defects: they either exclude at
    least some transgender women, or else they implicitly foster
    hierarchies among women, marginalizing transgender women in
    particular. In conclusion, I claim that the moral contestability of
    gender‐term deployments acts as a stimulus to regularly consider the
    provisionality and revisability of our deployments of the term
    \"woman.\""

- abstract: "This study characterized sexual orientation identities and
    sexual fluidity in attractions in a community-based sample of
    self-identified transgender and gender-nonconforming adults in
    Massachusetts. Participants were recruited in 2013 using bimodel
    methods (online and in person) to complete a one-time, Web-based
    quantitative survey that included questions about sexual orientation
    identity and sexual fluidity. Multivariable logistic regression
    models estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence
    intervals (95% CIs) to examine the correlates of self-reported
    changes in attractions ever in lifetime among the whole sample (n =
    452) and after transition among those who reported social gender
    transition (n = 205). The sample endorsed diverse sexual orientation
    identities: 42.7% queer, 19.0% other nonbinary, 15.7% bisexual,
    12.2% straight, and 10.4% gay/lesbian. Overall, 58.2% reported
    having experienced changes in sexual attractions in their lifetime.
    In adjusted models, trans masculine individuals were more likely
    than trans feminine individuals to report sexual fluidity in their
    lifetime (aRR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.34, 2.12). Among those who
    transitioned, 64.6% reported a change in attractions posttransition,
    and trans masculine individuals were less likely than trans feminine
    individuals to report sexual fluidity (aRR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.28,
    0.69). Heterogeneity of sexual orientation identities and sexual
    fluidity in attractions are the norm rather than the exception among
    gender minority people."

- abstract: "In some autobiographical narratives, transsexual has been
    narrated outside the gender binary. These narratives have the
    propensity to reconceptualize multiplicity of genders. However, the
    re/production of transsexual appears not only to be a function of
    how the subject position is represented but also a function of the
    structure of narrative. If this is so, then the following questions
    arise: What is the relation between the representation of a subject
    position in a narrative and the structure of narrative? and how does
    this relation function in the re/production of transsexual and
    gender multiplicity? In an analysis of one autobiographical
    interview, the author reads male-to-female transsexual as a subject
    position grounded in dichotomous gender that was disrupted only
    where ambiguity is allowed in the narrative structure, and this
    disruption was foreclosed through how the subject was represented
    and/or the structure of the narrative."

- abstract: Traditional conceptions of gender as a binary, man-or-woman
    categorization are being challenged in scholarship and in U.S.
    popular culture. Researchers across disciplines have rejected gender
    binarism; English dictionaries and style manuals have embraced the
    singular "they"; and social networking sites offer multiple gender
    options. These changes signal increased awareness that binary gender
    categorizations perpetuate structures of oppression that act on all
    people, but especially disadvantage transgender, non-binary, and
    intersex individuals. Mindful of this cultural shift, this paper
    explores how gender measurement is handled in recent scholarly
    publications in communication. Based on a qualitative content
    analysis of articles published in 2018--2019, it demonstrates that
    six leading U.S.-based communication journals published research
    that marginalizes non-cisnormative people through binary gender
    measurement. Arguing that it is the ethical responsibility of
    researchers to recognize the multiplicity of identities that are
    authentic to our informants, it concludes with recommendations for
    conceptualizing, measuring, and reporting gender beyond the binary,
    including a metric for gender that incorporates dual axes of gender
    identity and gender experience.

- abstract: Transgender identities and health are highly politicized in
    the United States leading to restrictions on relevant data
    collection in national health surveillance systems. This has serious
    implications on transgender population health research; an urgent
    area of study given the systemic discrimination faced by transgender
    individuals and the resultant social and health inequities. In this
    precarious political climate, obtaining high-quality data for
    research is challenging and in recent years, two data sources have
    formed the foundation of transgender health research in the United
    States, namely the 2015 United States Transgender Study and the
    Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System after the launch of the
    optional Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Module in 2014.
    While useful, there are serious challenges to using these data to
    study transgender health, specifically related to survey weighting
    methodologies, ascertainment of gender identity, and study design.
    In this article, we detail these challenges and discuss the
    strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches that
    have been implemented as well as clarify several common errors that
    exist in the literature. We feel that this contribution is necessary
    to provide accurate interpretation of the evidence that currently
    informs policy and priority setting for transgender population
    health and will provide vital insights for future studies with these
    now ubiquitous sources of data in the field.

- abstract: As the long-standing and ubiquitous racial inequities of the
    United States reached national attention, the public health
    community has witnessed the rise of "health equity tourism". This
    phenomenon is the process of previously unengaged investigators
    pivoting into health equity research without developing the
    necessary scientific expertise for high-quality work. In this essay,
    we define the phenomenon and provide an explanation of the
    antecedent conditions that facilitated its development. We also
    describe the consequences of health equity tourism -- namely,
    recapitulating systems of inequity within the academy and the
    dilution of a landscape carefully curated by scholars who have
    demonstrated sustained commitments to equity research as a primary
    scientific discipline and praxis. Lastly, we provide a set of
    principles that can guide novice equity researchers to becoming
    community members rather than mere tourists of health equity.

- abstract: In the social sciences, many quantitative research findings
    as well as presentations of demographics are related to
    participants' gender. Most often, gender is represented by a
    dichotomous variable with the possible responses of woman/man or
    female/male, although gender is not a binary variable. It is,
    however, rarely defined what is meant by gender. In this article, we
    deconstruct the concept 'gender' as consisting of several facets,
    and argue that the researcher needs to identify relevant aspects of
    gender in relation to their research question. We make a thorough
    exposition of considerations that the researcher should bear in mind
    when formulating questions about each facet, in order to exemplify
    how complex this construct is. We also remind the researcher that
    gender is not a binary category and discuss challenges in the
    balance between taking existing gender diversity into account and
    yet sorting participants into gender categorisations that function
    in statistical analyzes. To aid in this process, we provide an
    empirical example on how gender identity may be categorised when
    using a free-text response. Lastly, we suggest that other
    measurements than participants' gender might be better predictors of
    the outcome variable.

- abstract: This article argues that although gender is no longer widely
    considered to be a property of individuals, the alternative of
    viewing it in terms of performativity, where it is the outcome of
    linguistic and social performances, unnecessarily limits the
    possibilities of thinking of gender as a form of multiplicity that
    is both internally and externally differentiated. Any attempt to
    move beyond binary thinking in gender relations initiates a
    consideration of multiplicity, and the way in which multiplicity is
    conceptualized exerts a critical influence on the possibilities that
    are opened up. This article interrogates existing understandings of
    multiplicity and finds three actual or possible types -
    multiplicities of the same, characteristic of feminist approaches
    which we critique through a reconceptualization of desire;
    multiplicities of the third, characterized by anthropological,
    transgender and queer theory approaches; and multiplicities of
    difference and dispersion, typified by the rhizomatics and fluid
    theorizing of Deleuze and Guattari, Grosz and Olkowski. We propose
    an ontology of gender as a creative and productive form of desire,
    realized as proliferation in Deleuze and Guattari?s model of the
    rhizome. Gender identity is accordingly rethought as immanence,
    intensity and consistency.

    characteristics at admission to chemical dependency (CD) treatment
    by sexual orientation, examine sexual orientation as a predictor of
    co-occurring CD and mental health problems (hereafter referred to as
    co-occurring disorders \\[COD\\]), and to examine the effect of sexual
    orientation and COD on 1-year CD treatment outcomes (treatment
    completion, treatment reentry, and arrest) among men and
    women.Method:This retrospective cohort study used 2004--2008 data
    from publicly funded CD treatment programs in Washington State (n =
    69,525 clients). Bivariate comparisons were made using chi-square
    tests; logistic and Cox regressions were to estimate risk in
    multivariate analyses.Results:Risk factors associated with sexual
    minority status (lesbian/gay/bisexual) included COD, primary drug
    (vs. alcohol) use, and greater substance use. In multivariate
    analyses, sexual minority clients were more than twice as likely as
    their heterosexual counterparts to have COD. COD, but not sexual
    orientation, negatively predicted treatment completion and arrest
    overall in the year following treatment among male and female
    clients and positively predicted treatment reentry and intimate
    partner violence--related arrest among women. COD moderated the
    effect of sexual orientation on arrest; gay men with COD were less
    likely to be arrested, particularly for substance use and other
    violence--related crimes.Conclusions:These findings highlight the
    importance of assessing mental health among sexual minority clients
    in treatment settings and addressing issues specific to both female
    and male sexual minorities."

- abstract: It has been acknowledged that more research into the health
    and well-being of trans people is needed in order to identify
    important health issues. While recent studies have suggested using a
    two-question gender status measure to assess assigned sex at birth
    and gender identity, it is not well understood how participants
    understand and subsequently answer the questions. The study
    recruited a convenience sample of 50 people (25 trans and 25 cis)
    from the general population of Cleveland and Akron, OH. The study
    used cognitive interviewing methods with scripted, semi-structured
    and spontaneous probes when appropriate. Participants were asked to
    read questions out-loud, answer the questions, and explain why they
    answered the way they did. Interviews were audio recorded and
    transcribed prior to analysis. The gender status questions were
    found to be easy to use and understood by both trans and cis
    participants. The two-question gender status measure was able to
    encompass a diversity of identities within a trans sample and be
    consistently answered by the study's cis participants. The measures
    were able to differentiate between trans and cis groups. The
    two-step gender measure can be a useful tool in examining gender
    diversity within general population studies.

- abstract: "Evidenced by leading journals in academic medicine, health
    professions education has taken up the call to advance equitable
    healthcare. One pressing area where gaps and inequities are apparent
    is transgender (trans) people's access to gender-affirming medicine
    such as hormones and surgeries. Reasons for the dire state of care
    include education gaps. While specific content knowledge has been
    identified as lacking in medical school curricula, less research has
    focused on the complex social practices required of clinicians and
    educators working in gender-affirming medicine, and how these skills
    are learned through practice. In order to inform health professions
    education in this key area of need, we conducted a study to better
    understand the social practices, and the learning that occurs
    therein, of gender-affirming medicine. We identified the work
    processes of 22 clinicians, clinician-educators, trans patients, and
    clinical care administrators with attention to how policies and
    protocols influenced practice, learning, and teaching. The results
    of our study elucidate: (1) that practicing of gender-affirming
    medicine is strictly dictated by standardized assessment protocols,
    which serve as a form of curriculum; and (2) how health
    professionals learn and teach health advocacy as a form of
    resistance to protocols identified as creating inequities. These
    findings suggest an opportunity to view protocols---and their
    inherent limitations---more deliberately as teaching and learning
    tools, specifically for learning advocacy."

- abstract: Despite the 2013 decision to replace the diagnostic
    labelling of gender identity disorder with gender dysphoria, there
    remains wide consensus amongst scholars that transgender identities
    are pathologised. Yet the claim that trans identity has been
    pathologised has yet to be rigorously substantiated. Adapting a
    model for verifying the credibility of medicalisation claims, this
    inquiry confirms that the human phenomenon of gender-variance has
    underwent pathologisation to embed trans identity within a medical
    model by (1) historicising how trans identity became viewed as a
    medical condition; (2) highlighting that medical explanations for
    trans identity are adopted by trans people and the culture at large;
    and (3) showing that medical theory for trans identity gains
    traction over any other explanation.

- abstract: "There is limited information about how transgender,
    nonbinary, and other gender diverse (trans) people have been studied
    and represented by researchers. The objectives of this study were
    to: (1) increase access to trans research; (2) map and describe
    trans research across subject fields; and (3) identify evidence gaps
    and opportunities for more responsible research. Eligibility
    criteria were established to include empirical research of any
    design, which included trans participants or their personal
    information and that was published in English in peer-reviewed
    journals. A search of 15 academic databases resulted in 25,230
    references; data presented include 690 trans-focused articles that
    met the screening criteria and were published between 2010 and 2014.
    The 10 topics studied most frequently were: (1) therapeutics and
    surgeries; (2) gender identity and expression; (3) mental health;
    (4) biology and physiology; (5) discrimination and marginalization;
    (6) physical health; (7) sexual health, HIV, and sexually
    transmitted infections; (8) health and mental health services; (9)
    social support, relationships, and families; and (10) resilience,
    well-being, and quality of life. This map also highlights the
    relatively minor attention that has been paid to a number of study
    topics, including ethnicity, culture, race, and racialization;
    housing; income; employment; and space and place. Results of this
    review have the potential to increase awareness of existing trans
    research, to characterize evidence gaps, and to inform strategic
    research prioritization. With this information, it is more likely
    that trans communities and allies will be in a position to benefit
    from existing research and to hold researchers accountable."

- abstract: The purpose of this study is to more completely quantify
    smoking rate and support for smoke-free policies in private and
    public environments from a large sample of self-identified sexual
    and gender minority (SGM) populations.A targeted sampling strategy
    recruited participants from 4 Missouri Pride Festivals and online
    surveys targeted to SGM populations during the summer of 2008. A
    24-item survey gathered information on gender and sexual
    orientation, smoking status, and questions assessing behaviors and
    preferences related to smoke-free policies.The project recruited
    participants through Pride Festivals (n = 2,676) and Web-based
    surveys (n = 231) representing numerous sexual and gender
    orientations and the racial composite of the state of Missouri.
    Differences were found between the Pride Festivals sample and the
    Web-based sample, including smoking rates, with current smoking for
    the Web-based sample (22%) significantly less than the Pride
    Festivals sample (37%; p &lt; .0001). The SGM group (n = 2,162) was
    1.49 times more likely to be current smokers compared with the
    study's heterosexual group (n = 436; p = .005). Statistically fewer
    SGM racial minorities (33%) are current smokers compared with SGM
    Whites (37%; p = .04). Support and preferences for public and
    private smoke-free environments were generally low in the SGM
    population.The strategic targeting method achieved a large and
    diverse sample. The findings of high rates of smoking coupled with
    generally low levels of support for smoke-free public policies in
    the SGM community highlight the need for additional research to
    inform programmatic attempts to reduce tobacco use and increase
    support for smoke-free environments.

- abstract: The need for systematic methods for reviewing evidence is
    continuously increasing. Evidence mapping is one emerging method.
    There are no authoritative recommendations for what constitutes an
    evidence map or what methods should be used, and anecdotal evidence
    suggests heterogeneity in both. Our objectives are to identify
    published evidence maps and to compare and contrast the presented
    definitions of evidence mapping, the domains used to classify data
    in evidence maps, and the form the evidence map takes.

- abstract: Systematic reviews should build on a protocol that describes
    the rationale, hypothesis, and planned methods of the review; few
    reviews report whether a protocol exists. Detailed, well-described
    protocols can facilitate the understanding and appraisal of the
    review methods, as well as the detection of modifications to methods
    and selective reporting in completed reviews. We describe the
    development of a reporting guideline, the Preferred Reporting Items
    for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015
    (PRISMA-P 2015). PRISMA-P consists of a 17-item checklist intended
    to facilitate the preparation and reporting of a robust protocol for
    the systematic review. Funders and those commissioning reviews might
    consider mandating the use of the checklist to facilitate the
    submission of relevant protocol information in funding applications.
    Similarly, peer reviewers and editors can use the guidance to gauge
    the completeness and transparency of a systematic review protocol
    submitted for publication in a journal or other medium.

- abstract: Conflation of the terms and concepts of "sex" and "gender"
    continues to perpetuate the invisibility of sex and gender
    minorities and obscure information about the ways in which
    biological sex and gender affect health. The misuse of sex and
    gender terms and the sex and gender binaries can yield inaccurate
    results but also, more importantly, contributes to the erasure of
    intersex, transgender, nonbinary, and agender health experiences. In
    this article, we discuss ways in which public health researchers can
    use sex and gender terms correctly and center the health experiences
    of intersex, transgender, nonbinary, and agender individuals. This
    includes promoting sensitivity in approaching sex and gender
    minority communities, improving survey questions, and collaborating
    with GSM communities to improve research quality and participant
    experiences. Improving our standards for the quality of sex and
    gender term usage and centering sex and gender minorities in public
    health research are imperative to addressing the health inequalities
    faced by sex and gender minorities.

- abstract: "Although medical case reports have fallen out of favor in
    the era of the impact factor, there is a long tradition of using
    case reports for teaching and discovery. Some evidence indicates
    that writing case reports might improve medical students' critical
    thinking and writing skills and help prepare them for future
    scholarly work. From 2009 through 2015, students participating in
    the case reporting program at a VA hospital produced 250+ case
    reports, 35 abstracts, and 15 journal publications. Here, three
    medical students who published their case reports comment on what
    they learned from the experience. On the basis of their comments,
    the authors propose five educational benefits of case reporting:
    observation and pattern recognition skills; hypothesis-generating
    skills; understanding of patient-centered care; rhetorical
    versatility; and use of the case report as a rapidly publishable
    \"mini-thesis,\" which could fulfill MD thesis or scholarly
    concentration requirements. The authors discuss the concept of the
    case report as a \"hybrid narrative\" with simultaneous medical and
    humanistic significance, and its potential use to teach students
    about their dual roles as engaged listeners and scientists. Finally,
    the authors consider the limitations and pitfalls of case reports,
    including patient confidentiality issues, overinterpretation,
    emphasis on the rare, and low initial publication rates. Case
    reports allow students to contribute to medical literature, learn
    useful scholarly skills, and participate in a tradition that links
    them with past generations of physicians. The authors conclude that
    the case report can be an effective teaching tool with a broad range
    of potential educational benefits."

- abstract: This double Special Issue of Global Public Health presents a
    collection of articles that seek more adequately to represent sexual
    and gender diversities and to begin to rethink the relationship to
    HIV prevention and health promotion -- in both the resource rich
    nations of the global North, as well as in the more resource
    constrained nations of the global South. Reckoning with the reality
    that today the global response to HIV has failed to respond to the
    needs of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, and
    transgender persons, we turn our attention to processes and
    practices of categorisation and classification, and the entanglement
    of the multiple social worlds that constitute our understanding of
    each of these categories and people within the categories. Jointly,
    these articles provide critical perspectives on how defining and
    redefining categories may impact the conceptual frameworks and
    empirical evidence that inform global understandings of HIV
    infection, those communities most vulnerable, and our collective
    response to the evolving HIV epidemic.

    PrEP contributes to and interacts with a legacy of HIV
    experimentation on marginalized communities in resource-limited
    settings. This paper explores the complexity of PrEP research
    mistrust among Peruvian transgender (trans) women who completed a
    PrEP adherence intervention and those who refused participation
    (i.e. declined to enrol, voluntarily withdrew, and/or were lost to
    follow-up). Methods Data were derived from 86 trans women (mean age
    29 years) participants in the formative (four focus groups (n = 32),
    20 interviews) and the evaluation stages (34 interviews) of a social
    network-based PrEP intervention for trans women in Lima, Peru. The
    formative stage took place from May to July 2015, while the
    evaluative stage took place from April to May 2018. Audio files were
    transcribed verbatim and analysed via an immersion crystallization
    approach using Dedoose (v.6.1.18). Results Three paradoxes of trans
    women's participation in PrEP science as a \"key\" population emerged
    as amplifying mistrust: (1) increases in PrEP research targeting
    trans women but limited perceived improvements in HIV outcomes; (2)
    routine dismissal by research physicians and staff of PrEP-related
    side effects and the social realities of taking PrEP, resulting in
    questions about who PrEP research is really for and (3) persistent
    limitations on PrEP access for trans women despite increasing
    involvement in clinical trials, fostering feelings of being a
    \"guinea pig\" to advance PrEP science. Conclusions Findings highlight
    the wisdom inherent in PrEP mistrust as a reflection of trans
    women's experiences that underscore the broken bonds of trust
    between communities, researchers and the research enterprise. PrEP
    mistrust is amplified through perceived paradoxes that suggest to
    trans women that they are key experimental participants but not
    target PrEP users outside of research settings. Findings highlight
    the urgent need to reframe mistrust not as a characteristic of trans
    women to be addressed through education and outreach, but as a
    systemic institutional- and industry-level problem replicated,
    manifested and ultimately to be corrected, through global HIV
    science."

- abstract: "Abstract. The gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered
    (GLBT) population is a good example of a demographic group that has
    been understudied because it is difficult to develop a subsample of
    sufficient size from typical national samples. Here we exploit the
    extraordinary size of a 2006 online election day survey (with about
    35,000 respondents) to examine how the GLBT community behaves
    politically. While it will surprise no one that this community
    bestowed little support on Stephen Harper's Conservative party in
    the 2006 federal election, the factors behind such a consistent vote
    pattern are not adequately understood. In order to shed more light
    on the voting behaviour of the GLBT electorate, we develop a
    socio-demographic profile of the group, and explore three
    explanatory angles: 1) salience of issue campaign dynamics, given
    that the same-sex marriage issue was prominent in 2006; 2)
    ideological and attitudinal proclivities; and 3) strategic
    considerations.Résumé. La population gaie, lesbiennes, bisexuels et
    transgenres (GLBT) est un exemple d'un groupe démographique qui a
    été peu étudié, car il est difficile de développer un
    sous-échantillon de taille suffisante à partir d'échantillons
    nationaux. Ici, nous exploitons la taille extraordinaire d'une
    enquête enligne du jour du scrutin fédérale du 2006 (avec environ
    35.000 répondants) d'examiner comment la communauté GLBT se comporte
    politiquement. Bien qu'il ne surprendra personne que cette
    communauté accordé peu d'appui sur Parti conservateur de Stephen
    Harper lors de l'élection fédérale de 2006, les facteurs qui
    expliquent un tel motif ne sont pas bien compris. Afin de jeter plus
    de lumière sur le comportement de vote de l'électorat GLBT, nous
    développons un profil sociodémographique de cette groupe, et
    d'explorer trois angles explicatives: 1) pertinence de la question
    du mariage de même sexe, 2) tendances idéologiques, et 3) des
    considérations stratégiques."

- abstract: "Purpose: When inquiring about the gender of research
    participants, most studies use self-generated questions about gender
    or questions prepared by researchers that have been evaluated for
    comprehension by transgender and gender diverse (TGD) and cisgender
    individuals. However, many gaps still exist in this area, including
    identifying how TGD people would like to see their gender
    represented in questions about gender identity. To address this
    issue, we explored the perspectives of TGD people regarding the
    construction of questions about gender.Methods: In this online study
    of 695 TGD people (Mage = 25.52), participants provided written
    suggestions for how to ask about gender and these responses were
    analyzed thematically. Data were collected between fall 2015 and
    summer 2017.Results: Three broad categories of responses emerged:
    (1) specific identities to include in response options; (2) specific
    questions to ask about gender; and (3) qualifiers/nuanced
    considerations.Conclusion: Participants provided a variety of
    suggestions for how to ask about gender and future research is
    needed to explore the implementation of these suggestions.
    Recommendations are provided for options that researchers can
    explore for how to ask about gender. These findings highlight the
    ways that TGD people would like their gender to be asked about,
    which is necessary information to ensure that questions about gender
    reflect TGD people's identities accurately."

- abstract: "Few comparative data are available internationally to
    examine health differences by transgender identity. A barrier to
    monitoring the health and well-being of transgender people is the
    lack of inclusion of measures to assess natal sex/gender identity
    status in surveys. Data were from a cross-sectional anonymous online
    survey of members (n \\> 36,000) of a sexual networking website
    targeting men who have sex with men in Spanish- and
    Portuguese-speaking countries/territories in Latin America/the
    Caribbean, Portugal, and Spain. Natal sex/gender identity status was
    assessed using a two-step method (Step 1: assigned birth sex, Step
    2: current gender identity). Male-to-female (MTF) and female-to-male
    (FTM) participants were compared to non-transgender males in
    age-adjusted regression models on socioeconomic status (SES)
    (education, income, sex work), masculine gender conformity,
    psychological health and well-being (lifetime suicidality, past-week
    depressive distress, positive self-worth, general self-rated health,
    gender related stressors), and sexual health (HIV-infection,
    past-year STIs, past-3 month unprotected anal or vaginal sex). The
    two-step method identified 190 transgender participants (0.54 %; 158
    MTF, 32 FTM). Of the 12 health-related variables, six showed
    significant differences between the three groups: SES, masculine
    gender conformity, lifetime suicidality, depressive distress,
    positive self-worth, and past-year genital herpes. A two-step
    approach is recommended for health surveillance efforts to assess
    natal sex/gender identity status. Cognitive testing to formally
    validate assigned birth sex and current gender identity survey items
    in Spanish and Portuguese is encouraged."

- abstract: Purpose of review  This article describes methodological
    challenges, gaps, and opportunities in US transgender health
    research. Recent findings  Lack of large prospective observational
    studies and intervention trials, limited data on risks and benefits
    of sex affirmation (e.g., hormones and surgical interventions), and
    inconsistent use of definitions across studies hinder evidence-based
    care for transgender people. Systematic high-quality observational
    and intervention-testing studies may be carried out using several
    approaches, including general population-based, health
    systems-based, clinic-based, venue-based, and hybrid designs. Each
    of these approaches has its strength and limitations; however,
    harmonization of research efforts is needed. Ongoing development of
    evidence-based clinical recommendations will benefit from a series
    of observational and intervention studies aimed at identification,
    recruitment, and follow-up of transgender people of different ages,
    from different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and
    with diverse gender identities. Summary  Transgender health research
    faces challenges that include standardization of lexicon, agreed
    upon population definitions, study design, sampling, measurement,
    outcome ascertainment, and sample size. Application of existing and
    new methods is needed to fill existing gaps, increase the scientific
    rigor and reach of transgender health research, and inform
    evidence-based prevention and care for this underserved population.

- abstract: A community-based participatory research partnership
    explored HIV risk and potentially effective intervention
    characteristics to reduce exposure and transmission among immigrant
    Latino men who have sex with men living in the rural south-eastern
    USA. Twenty-one participants enrolled and completed a total of 62
    ethnographic in-depth interviews. Mean age was 31 (range 18--48)
    years and English-language proficiency was limited; 18 participants
    were from Mexico. Four participants reported having sex with men and
    women during the past three months; two participants self-identified
    as male-to-female transgender. Qualitative themes that emerged
    included a lack of accurate information about HIV and prevention;
    the influence of social-political contexts to sexual risk; and
    barriers to healthcare services. We also identified eight
    characteristics of potentially effective interventions for HIV
    prevention. Our findings suggest that socio-political contexts must
    be additional targets of change to reduce and eliminate HIV health
    disparities experienced by immigrant Latino men who have sex with
    men.

- abstract: "It has been hypothesized that bacterial biofilms on breast
    implants may cause chronic inflammation leading to capsular
    contracture. The association between bacterial biofilms of removed
    implants and capsular contracture was investigated.Breast implants
    explanted between 2006 and 2010 at five participating centres for
    plastic and reconstructive surgery were investigated by sonication.
    Bacterial cultures derived from sonication were correlated with
    patient, surgical and implant characteristics, and the degree of
    capsular contracture.The study included 121 breast implants from 84
    patients, of which 119 originated from women and two from men
    undergoing gender reassignment. Some 50 breast prostheses were
    implanted for reconstruction, 48 for aesthetic reasons and 23
    implants were used as temporary expander devices. The median
    indwelling time was 4·0 (range 0·1--32) years for permanent implants
    and 3 (range 1--6) months for temporary devices. Excluding nine
    implants with clinical signs of infection, sonication cultures were
    positive in 40 (45 per cent) of 89 permanent implants and in 12 (52
    per cent) of 23 temporary devices. Analysis of permanent implants
    showed that a positive bacterial culture after sonication correlated
    with the degree of capsular contracture: Baker I, two of 11
    implants; Baker II, two of ten; Baker III, nine of 23; and Baker IV,
    27 of 45 (P &lt; 0·001). The most frequent organisms were
    Propionibacterium acnes (25 implants) and coagulase-negative
    staphylococci (21).Sonication cultures correlated with the degree of
    capsular contracture, indicating the potential causative role of
    bacterial biofilms in the pathogenesis of capsular contracture.

- abstract: "Transgender (heretofore shortened to ?trans?) people remain
    largely excluded from involvement and leadership in the research
    conducted with their communities. As a result, few trans insiders
    (i.e. trans people who are also researchers) are ever in the
    position of designing, conducting, and disseminating knowledge from
    trans research. As such, social narratives of trans experiences are
    often inaccurate, lacking nuance, or directly damaging. This paper
    argues that insider?outsider IO research exists on a value
    ?staircase?, moving from no involvement to full leadership. Using
    this staircase model, the researchers suggest that elevating and
    empowering trans people to consult in, conduct, and lead trans
    research benefits both the trans and research communities.
    Meaningful trans involvement in research provides more in-depth
    data, builds more constructive rapport with community members, and
    produces more effective research than the norm of purely outsider
    research in the field. The paper then details the results from a
    study of 6 trans women?s experience of undergoing IO-led trans
    research, with Shoshana as the main researcher and interviewer. The
    study identified three main themes: ?The Impact of Trans-Led
    Research,? ?Constructive Approaches to the Research Process,? and
    ?Community-Controlled Narratives as a Priority?. This paper
    concludes that IO-led research facilitates an empowering research
    process for participants, communities, and researchers, and that
    future research in the area should consider trans representation and
    control as a priority."

- abstract: Demands for recognition of gender diversity and transgender
    people are growing. We tested non-binary sex and gender measures
    using nationally representative samples of US adults to assess
    feasibility for general population surveys. We find more support for
    a two-step categorical approach, with separate questions about natal
    sex and gender identity, than for a single question assessing
    transgender status as the latter was less reliable within our online
    surveys and over time. We also consider the challenge of determining
    measurement reliability for fluid characteristics and argue that
    using categorical and gradational gender measures in combination
    should become standard practice.

- abstract: Gender input forms act as gates to accessing information,
    websites, and services online. Non-binary people regularly have to
    interact with them, though many do not offer non-binary gender
    options. This results in non-binary individuals having to either
    choose an incorrect gender category or refrain from using a site or
    service---which is occasionally infeasible (e.g., when accessing
    health services). We tested five different forms through a survey
    with binary and non-binary participants (n = 350) in three
    contexts---a digital health form, a social media website, and a
    dating app. Our results indicate that the majority of participants
    found binary "male or female" forms exclusive and uncomfortable to
    fill out across all contexts. We conclude with design considerations
    for improving gender input forms and consequently their underlying
    gender model in databases. Our work aims to sensitize designers of
    (online) gender web forms to the needs and desires of non-binary
    people.

- abstract: Approximately one million gay and lesbian Americans are
    veterans, and rates of engagement in the Veterans Affairs (VA)
    health care system may be increasing for both sexual and gender
    minority veterans. Very little research has examined the experience
    of these veterans when receiving care at VA health care facilities.
    The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences, beliefs,
    and preferences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT)
    veterans in their communication with VA health care providers. LGBT
    veterans (n = 58) participated in focus groups or individual
    interviews and completed self-report measures at two southern VA
    hospitals. Approximately 2/3 of veterans report that none of their
    VA providers have specifically asked about their sexual orientation,
    and 24% of the veterans indicate that they have not disclosed their
    orientation to any VA provider. Although some veterans want
    providers to initiate these discussions, veterans also expressed
    fears about disclosure and its possible negative consequences.
    Similarly, LGBT veterans report varied opinions about the
    appropriateness of routine assessment of minority status. Only 28%
    of these veterans experience VA as welcoming to them as LGBT
    veterans. Systematic training is needed for all VA providers about
    the rationale for assessing sexual and gender orientation. Staff
    education should include specific skills for initiating these
    assessments, and ways of responding to veteran concerns about
    discussing this topic in the VA health care system. (PsycINFO

- abstract: Objectives. Institutional review boards (IRBs), designed to
    protect individual study participants, do not routinely assess
    community consent, risks, and benefits. Community groups are
    establishing ethics review processes to determine whether and how
    research is conducted in their communities. To strengthen the ethics
    review of community-engaged research, we sought to identify and
    describe these processes.Methods. In 2008 we conducted an online
    survey of US-based community groups and community--institutional
    partnerships involved in human-participants research. We identified
    109 respondents who met participation criteria and had ethics review
    processes in place.Results. The respondents' processes mainly
    functioned through community--institutional partnerships,
    community-based organizations, community health centers, and tribal
    organizations. These processes had been created primarily to ensure
    that the involved communities were engaged in and directly benefited
    from research and were protected from research harms. The primary
    process benefits included giving communities a voice in determining
    which studies were conducted and ensuring that studies were relevant
    and feasible, and that they built community capacity. The primary
    process challenges were the time and resources needed to support the
    process.Conclusions. Community-based processes for ethics review
    consider community-level ethical issues that institution-based IRBs
    often do not.

- abstract: Joy is a crucial element of people's everyday lives that has
    been understudied by sociologists. This is particularly true for
    scholarship about transgender people. To address what we term a joy
    deficit in sociology, we analyze 40 in-depth interviews with trans
    people in which they were asked what they find joyful about being
    trans. Their responses demonstrate the methodological and
    theoretical importance of asking about joy. Four main themes emerged
    from the interviews. First, interviewees easily answered the
    question about joy. Second, contrary to common assumptions, we found
    that transgender people expressed joy in being members of a
    marginalized group and said that they preferred being transgender.
    Third, embracing a marginalized identity caused the quality of their
    lives to improve, increasing self-confidence, body positivity, and
    sense of peace. Finally, being from a marginalized group facilitated
    meaningful connections with other people. Our findings demonstrate a
    vital need to address the joy deficit that exists in the
    sociological scholarship on transgender people specifically, and
    marginalized groups more generally. Bridging the sociology of
    knowledge and narratives, we show how accentuating joy offers nuance
    to understandings of the lived experiences of marginalized people
    that has been absent from much of sociological scholarship.

- abstract: "This qualitative study explored the resilience of 13
    transgender youth of color in the southeastern region of the U.S.
    The definition of resilience framing this study was a participant's
    ability to \"bounce back\" from challenging experiences as transgender
    youth of color. Using a phenomenological research tradition and a
    feminist, intersectionality (intercategorical) theoretical
    framework, the research question guiding the study was: \"What are
    the daily lived experiences of resilience transgender youth of color
    describe as they negotiate intersections of transprejudice and
    racism?\" The researchers' individuated findings included five major
    domains of the essence of participants' daily lived experiences of
    resilience despite experiencing racism and transprejudice: (1)
    evolving, simultaneous self-definition of racial/ethnic and gender
    identities, (2) being aware of adultism experiences, (3)
    self-advocacy in educational systems, (4) finding one's place in the
    LGBTQQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning)
    youth community, and (5) use of social media to affirm one's
    identities as a transgender youth of color. Implications for
    practice, research, and advocacy, in addition to the study's
    limitations are discussed."

- abstract: Decades of research suggest certain risk factors, including
    individual characteristics, increase an individual?s likelihood of
    being victimized. Measuring these risk factors then becomes crucial
    for movement forward in victimology. Recent research suggests the
    increasing need to measure the concepts of sex assigned at birth,
    gender identity, and sexual identity, all of whom have been linked
    to risk of victimization. However, it remains to be seen how these
    concepts are currently being measured, how their measurement has
    evolved, and if these concepts are being measured regularly,
    especially in large-scale national data efforts. This study seeks to
    examine the changes, or lack thereof, in measurement of the concepts
    of sex, gender identity, and sexual identity in seven major social
    surveys used in victimology research. Changes to wording, responses,
    and the number of questions regarding each of these concepts is
    discussed along with suggestions for improving measurement and
    implications for victimization research.

    pre-exposure prophylaxis decreases sexual acquisition of HIV
    infection. We sought to evaluate the renal safety of TDF in
    HIV-uninfected persons. Design and methods:  The Iniciativa
    Profilaxis Pre-Exposición (iPrEx) study randomly assigned 2499
    HIV-seronegative men and transgender women who have sex with men
    (MSM) to receive oral daily TDF coformulated with emtricitabine
    (FTC/TDF) or placebo. Serum creatinine and phosphorus during
    randomized treatment and after discontinuation were measured, and
    creatinine clearance (CrCl) was estimated by the Cockcroft--Gault
    equation. Indicators of proximal renal tubulopathy (fractional
    excretion of phosphorus and uric acid, urine protein, and glucose)
    were measured in a substudy. Results:  There was a small but
    statistically significant decrease in CrCl from baseline in the
    active arm, compared to placebo, which was first observed at week 4
    (mean change: −2.4 vs. −1.1 ml/min; P = 0.02), persisted through the
    last on-treatment visit (mean change: +0.3 vs. +1.8 ml/min; P =
    0.02), and resolved after stopping pre-exposure prophylaxis (mean
    change: −0.1 vs. 0.0 ml/min; P = 0.83). The effect was confirmed
    when stratifying by drug detection. The effect of FTC/TDF on CrCl
    did not vary by race, age, or history of hypertension. There was no
    difference in serum phosphate trends between the treatment arms. In
    the substudy, two participants receiving placebo had indicators of
    tubulopathy. Conclusions:  In HIV-seronegative MSM, randomization to
    FTC/TDF was associated with a very mild nonprogressive decrease in
    CrCl that was reversible and managed with routine serum creatinine
    monitoring."

    the field, these keywords begin to elucidate a conceptual vocabulary
    for transgender studies. Some of the submissions offer a deep and
    resilient resistance to the entire project of mapping the field
    terminologically; some reveal yet-unrealized critical potentials for
    the field; some take existing terms from canonical thinkers and
    develop the significance for transgender studies; some offer
    overviews of well-known methodologies and demonstrate their

- abstract: "Previous research suggests that sexual minority (lesbian,
    gay, and bisexual \\[LGB\\]) university students face unique
    challenges during the adjustment to college that their heterosexual
    peers do not. Furthermore, sexual minority students, and
    particularly those identifying as bisexual, at rural campuses in the
    United States may experience additional struggles because of their
    environment. The authors undertook this study in an attempt to
    understand the challenges facing LGB students as they transition to
    college life on rural campuses. A small, exploratory sample of 56
    sexual minority participants attending rural colleges in the United
    States provided data on measures of college adjustment. Using
    content analysis of qualitative data and correlational analysis of
    quantitative data, the following themes emerged: challenges making
    new friends, difficulty with roommates, and when or whether to
    disclose sexual orientation. Comparisons between sexual minorities
    (bisexual to homosexual) were also conducted to explore the unique
    experiences of bisexual individuals."

- abstract: "Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people---including members
    of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer
    communities---are understudied and underrepresented in research.
    Current sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) questions do
    not sufficiently engage SGM people, and there is a critical gap in
    understanding how SOGI questions reduce inclusion and accurate
    empirical representation. We conducted a qualitative study to answer
    the question, \"For SGM people, what are the major limitations with
    current SOGI questions?\" Focus groups probed reactions to SOGI
    questions adapted from prior national surveys and clinical best
    practice guidelines. Questions were refined and presented in
    semi-structured cognitive interviews. Template analysis using a
    priori themes guided analysis. There were 74 participants: 55 in
    nine focus groups and 19 in cognitive interviews. Participants were
    diverse: 51.3% identified as gender minorities, 87.8% as sexual
    minorities, 8.1% as Hispanic/Latinx, 13.5% as Black or
    African-American, and 43.2% as Non-white. Two major themes emerged:
    (1) SOGI questions did not allow for identity fluidity and
    complexity, reducing inclusion and representation, and (2) SOGI
    question stems and answer choices were often not clear as to which
    SOGI dimension was being assessed. To our knowledge, this represents
    the largest body of qualitative data studying SGM perspectives when
    responding to SOGI questions. We present recommendations for future
    development and use of SOGI measures. Attention to these topics may
    improve meaningful participation of SGM people in research and
    implementation of such research within and for SGM communities."

- abstract: Trans people are exposed to multiple human right violations
    in clinical practice and research. From 1975 on, gender transition
    processes have been classified as a mental disorder in diagnostic
    classification manuals, a classification that was removed recently
    from ICD, International Classification of Diseases, and continues in
    DSM, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Trans
    people in different world regions are forced to accept psychiatric
    diagnoses and assessment in order to get access to trans health
    care, subject to reparative therapies and exposed to transphobic
    institutional and social discrimination and violence. In many
    countries, gender identity laws include medical requirements, such
    as psychiatric diagnosis, hormone treatment, genital surgery, or
    sterilization. In the scientific literature, a frequent
    pathologization of trans experiences can be identified, by means of
    pathologizing conceptualizations, terminologies, visual
    representations, and practices, as well as ethnocentric biases.

- abstract: "Newer forms of community-based participatory research
    (CBPR) prioritize community control over community engagement, and
    articles that outline some of the challenges inherent in this
    approach to CBPR are imperative in terms of advancing knowledge and
    practice. This article outlines the community control strategy
    utilized by Trans PULSE, an Ontario-wide research initiative devoted
    to understanding the ways in which social exclusion, cisnormativity
    (the belief that transgender (trans) identities or bodies are less
    authentic or ?normal?), and transphobia shape the provision of
    services and affect health outcomes for trans people in Ontario,
    Canada. While we have been successful in building and supporting a
    solid model of community control in research, challenges have
    emerged related to: power differentials between community and
    academic partners, unintentional disempowerment of community members
    through the research process, the impact of community-level trauma
    on team dynamics, and differing visions about the importance and
    place of anti-racism work. Challenges are detailed as ?lessons
    learned? and a series of key questions for CBPR teams to consider
    are offered."

    the field; some take existing terms from canonical thinkers and
    develop the significance for transgender studies; some offer

- abstract: "Background: This article is by a group of trans and
    nonbinary researchers and experts in the field of trans health who
    have conducted an analysis of trans health research needs.Aims: To
    highlight topics that need further research and to outline key
    considerations for those conducting research in our field.Methods:
    The first author conducted semi-structured interviews with all
    coauthors, and these were used to create a first draft of this
    manuscript. This draft was circulated to all authors, with edits
    made until consensus was reached among the authors.Results: More
    comprehensive long-term research that centers trans people's
    experiences is needed on the risks and benefits of gender affirming
    hormones and surgeries. The trans health research field also needs
    to have a broader focus beyond medical transition or gender
    affirmation, including general health and routine healthcare; trans
    people's lives without, before, and after medical gender
    affirmation; and sexuality, fertility, and reproductive healthcare
    needs. More research is also needed on social determinants of
    health, including ways to make healthcare settings and other
    environments safer and more supportive; social and legal gender
    recognition; the needs of trans people who are most marginalized;
    and the ways in which healing happens within trans communities. The
    second part of this article highlights key considerations for
    researchers, the foremost being acknowledging trans community
    expertise and centering trans community members' input into research
    design and interpretation of findings, in advisory and/or researcher
    roles. Ethical considerations include maximizing benefits and
    minimizing harms (beneficence) and transparency and accountability
    to trans communities. Finally, we note the importance of
    conferences, grant funding, working with students, and
    multidisciplinary teams.Discussion: This article outlines topics and
    issues needing further consideration to make the field of trans
    health research more responsive to the needs of trans people. This
    work is limited by our authorship group being mostly White, all
    being Anglophone, and residing in the Global North."

- abstract: The transgender population has been subject to a troubled
    history of ethically and methodologically flawed research practices.
    Whilst interest and ethical standards have both risen, there remains
    little specific methodological consideration of research with
    transgender participants. This article draws on practical
    experiences of doing research with transgender communities, and
    insider group status, to construct six categories to consider when
    working on trans-focused research. These categories include the
    importance of transgender history, the assurance of transparency,
    the significance of nuanced language use, the benefits of feminist
    methodological contributions, the value of intersectionality and the
    necessity of respecting trans spaces. The article concludes by
    reflecting on the overlapping and non-exhaustive nature of these
    categories, and wider structural concerns that may trouble knowledge
    production more generally.

- abstract: "Using queerness itself as a category of analysis seems to
    invite a new round of debate devoted to who is 'really queer'. A
    voice that originated from one set of margins begins to create its
    own marginalized voices. These twin problems of identities --
    boundaries and hierarchies -- emerge whenever we try to base
    politics on identity. (Wilchins, 2002: 29)IntroductionAmong
    non-binary people, there is a vast heterogeneity of experiences and
    self-conceptualisations. Despite such differences, a striking
    commonality was observed among participants: insecurity in relation
    to gender. This could manifest as an internal uncertainty over
    whether one was 'trans enough', or fear of not being seen as trans
    enough by other people. This chapter will explore this phenomenon,
    while considering how hegemonic gendered expectations affect not
    only the ability to socially exert, but to internally formulate a
    non-binary gender identity. This exploration cuts across the
    original research questions, as feelings of insecurity were
    manifested in relation to experiences of queer community
    interaction, everyday experiences and accessing (or concern over
    accessing) medical support. Further, introspection was, perhaps
    predictably, strongly influenced by societal gender norms (both
    within and outside queer communities), which could be internalised,
    resisted, or both simultaneously.I begin by highlighting how
    non-binary people who had not accessed gender-affirming medical
    services could view those who had as 'more legitimate' than
    themselves, even if they did not want such access. Critically,
    participants didn't view others who weren't medically transitioning
    as less legitimate. Rather, they held themselves to different
    standards of validity, highlighting how the anxiety of 'realness'
    often operated at the level of the self. Participants were
    self-aware and critical of such feelings as problematic. This may be
    suggestive of difficulties with, or low self-esteem in relation to,
    gender identity (Neff, 2003).I then argue that hegemonic medicalised
    narratives of what it 'means to be transgender' have shaped queer
    community interactions. I show how community tensions can manifest
    with regards to non-binary people being made to feel 'not trans
    enough' by other members of trans communities. Binary-oriented trans
    people could sometimes exhibit hostility towards particular
    identities, or construct implicit hierarchies of legitimacy in order
    to self-validate. Such practices serve to evidence the problematic
    nature of processes where trans/non-binary identities are often only
    validated (by doctors, the law, family or friends, or in day-to-day
    social interactions) once difficult or painful processes have been
    navigated or performed."

- abstract: Accurate data collection from LGBTIQ+ communities is crucial
    for public health research and the provision of equitable services.
    Emergent fluid, multiple, trans and non-binary gender identities
    complicate data collection in ways that make an excellent case-study
    for rethinking the categorization of such data. In this article, we
    explore some of the obstacles to collecting data from trans,
    gender-diverse and non-binary (TGD) communities, and the
    difficulties in synthesizing meaning about fluid or multiple
    identity categories. We review a selection of international surveys
    from the last 10 years and then present a case-study of data
    collection in an Australian mixed-methods study of LGBTQ+ young
    people's uses of social media. In doing so we draw upon trans and
    gender diverse people's lived experiences to reinterpret our survey
    dataset in which responses that 'refused categorisation' were
    initially removed. We argue that theorizing the 'social life of
    data' -- that is analysing the disciplinary orientation and purpose
    of research, while also acknowledging the moment and site of data
    collection, the methods used, and the mutable meanings in play --
    better accounts for the lived experiences of gender beyond binary
    and static identities.

- abstract: As part of an internet-based study to investigate
    experiences of sexual minority youth in the U.S., 544 youth, ages
    14--19, were surveyed about their need for services, where they
    preferred to receive these services, and their preferred method of
    service delivery. The survey was anonymous and youth were recruited
    from LGBTQ-specific listservs and venues as well as through social
    networking sites as a way of reaching youth often not represented in
    LGBTQ surveys. Youth highly endorsed many types of services,
    settings, and modes of delivery. Some subgroup differences emerged.
    Transgender youth and those uncertain about their gender identity
    expressed stronger interest than others in services to address
    stress, family issues, and self-defense, and in receiving support
    and guidance from LGBTQ adults. Few differences in service
    preferences along demographic lines such as race/ethnicity emerged;
    however, African American youth were more likely than others to
    prefer services offered in a place of worship. Contrary to
    predictions, geographic and community variables were not related to
    service type, delivery format, or location preferences.

- abstract: Recently, scholars and activists have turned their attention
    toward improving the measurement of sex and gender in survey
    research. The focus of this effort has been on including answer
    options beyond ?male? and ?female? to questions about the
    respondent?s gender. This is an important step toward both
    reflecting the diversity of gendered lives and better aligning
    survey measurement practice with contemporary gender theory.
    However, our systematic examination of questionnaires, manuals, and
    other technical materials from four of the largest and
    longest-running surveys in the United States indicates that there
    are a number of other issues with how gender is conceptualized and
    measured in social surveys that also deserve attention, including
    essentialist practices that treat sex and gender as synonymous,
    easily determined by others, obvious, and unchanging over the life
    course. We find that these understandings extend well beyond direct
    questions about the respondent?s gender, permeating the surveys. A
    hyper-gendered world of ?males? and ?females,? ?brothers? and
    ?sisters,? and ?husbands? and ?wives? shapes what we can see in
    survey data. If not altered, surveys will continue to reproduce
    statistical representations that erase important dimensions of
    variation and likely limit understanding of the processes that
    perpetuate social inequality.

    associated risk factors in a sample of sexual minority men and women
    in Jamaica, a country that is widely known for its high societal
    rejection of homosexuality. Poor relationships with family, negative
    or abusive experiences related to one's sexual orientation, and
    greater openness about one's sexual orientation were independent
    risk factors for Axis I disorders. Prevention of mental disorders in
    sexual minorities in Jamaica should focus on rebuilding family
    support and promoting social acceptance of sexual minorities.

- abstract: This study examined associations between alcohol misuse and
    childhood maltreatment and out-of-home placement among urban
    lesbian, gay, and bisexual (referred to as two-spirit) American
    Indian and Alaska Native adults. In a multi-site study, data were
    obtained from 294 individuals who consumed alcohol during the past
    year. The results indicated that 72.3% of men and 62.4% of women
    engaged in hazardous and harmful alcohol use and 50.8% of men and
    48.7% of women met criteria for past-year alcohol dependence. The
    most common types of childhood maltreatment were physical abuse
    among male drinkers (62.7%) and emotional abuse (71.8%) among female
    drinkers. Men and women reported high percentages of out-of-home
    placement (39% and 47%, respectively). Logistic multiple regressions
    found that for male drinkers boarding school attendance and foster
    care placement were significant predictors of past-year alcohol
    dependence. For female drinkers, being adopted was significantly
    associated with a decreased risk of past-year drinking binge or
    spree. Dose-response relationships, using number of childhood
    exposures as a predictor, were not significant. The results
