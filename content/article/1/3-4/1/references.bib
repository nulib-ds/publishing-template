	abstract = {The purpose of this review is to create a set of provisional criteria for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) to refer to when assessing the ethical orientation of transgender health research proposals. We began by searching for literature on this topic using databases and the reference lists of key articles, resulting in a preliminary set of criteria. We then collaborated to develop the following nine guidelines: (1) Whenever possible, research should be grounded, from inception to dissemination, in a meaningful collaboration with community stakeholders; (2) language and framing of transgender health research should be non-stigmatizing; (3) research should be disseminated back to the community; (4) the diversity of the transgender and gender diverse (TGGD) community should be accurately reflected and sensitively reflected; (5) informed consent must be meaningful, without coercion or undue influence; (6) the protection of participant confidentiality should be paramount; (7) alternative consent procedures should be considered for TGGD minors; (8) research should align with current professional standards that refute conversion, reorientation, or reparative therapy; and (9) IRBs should guard against the temptation to avoid, limit, or delay research on this subject.},

Article records (N = 94) on childhood ‘gender identity’ and ‘expression’ published between 1999 and 2008 inclusive were evaluated for two kinds of cisgenderism, the ideology that invalidates or pathologises self-designated genders that contrast with external designations. Misgendering language contradicts children's own gender assignations and was less frequent than pathologising language which constructs children's own gender assignations and expression as disordered. Articles on children's gender identity/expression are increasingly impactful within psychology. Cisgenderism is neither increasing nor decreasing overall. Mental health professionals are more cisgenderist than other authors. Articles by members of an ‘invisible college’ structured around the most prolific author in this area are more cisgenderist and impactful than other articles. We suggest how authors and editors can implement American Psychological Association policy and change scientific discourse about children's genders.},

	abstract = {Given that an estimated 0.6\% of the U.S. population is transgender (trans) and that large health disparities for this population have been documented, government and research organizations are increasingly expanding measures of sex/gender to be trans inclusive. Options suggested for trans community surveys, such as expansive check-all-that-apply gender identity lists and write-in options that offer maximum flexibility, are generally not appropriate for broad population surveys. These require limited questions and a small number of categories for analysis. Limited evaluation has been undertaken of trans-inclusive population survey measures for sex/gender, including those currently in use. Using an internet survey and follow-up of 311 participants, and cognitive interviews from a maximum-diversity sub-sample (n = 79), we conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of two existing measures: a two-step question developed in the United States and a multidimensional measure developed in Canada. We found very low levels of item missingness, and no indicators of confusion on the part of cisgender (non-trans) participants for both measures. However, a majority of interview participants indicated problems with each question item set. Agreement between the two measures in assessment of gender identity was very high (K = 0.9081), but gender identity was a poor proxy for other dimensions of sex or gender among trans participants. Issues to inform measure development or adaptation that emerged from analysis included dimensions of sex/gender measured, whether non-binary identities were trans, Indigenous and cultural identities, proxy reporting, temporality concerns, and the inability of a single item to provide a valid measure of sex/gender. Based on this evaluation, we recommend that population surveys meant for multi-purpose analysis consider a new Multidimensional Sex/Gender Measure for testing that includes three simple items (one asked only of a small sub-group) to assess gender identity and lived gender, with optional additions. We provide considerations for adaptation of this measure to different contexts.},

Results from Phase I of the Trans PULSE Project, a community-based research project in Ontario, Canada, are presented. Based on qualitative data from focus groups with 85 trans community members, a theoretical framework describing how erasure functions to impact experiences interacting with the health care system was developed. Two key sites of erasure were identified: informational erasure and institutional erasure. How these processes work in a mutually reinforcing manner to erase trans individuals and communities and produce a system in which a trans patient or client is seen as an anomaly is shown. Thus, the impetus often falls on trans individuals to attempt to remedy systematic deficiencies. The concept of cisnormativity is introduced to aid in explaining the pervasiveness of trans erasure. Strategies for change are identified.},

The questions matter, as does the way gender/sex responses may be categorized, which has received less focus. In this article, we report on the “Gender/Sex 3×3,” which we developed via two studies to produce a novel framework for conceptualizing, measuring, and categorizing gender/sex. It represents two intersecting dimensions: “gender trajectory” (cisgender/transgender/allogender [i.e., neither cisgender nor transgender]) and “binary relation” (binary/nonbinary/allobinary [i.e., neither binary nor nonbinary]). In Study 1, we created gender/sex questions structured by the Gender/Sex 3×3 and asked 737 gender/sex-diverse participants to directly evaluate them. Descriptive quantitative feedback indicated the comprehensibility and inclusivity of the questions; qualitative feedback suggested wording changes. In Study 2, we tested these revised questions with 317 gender/sex-diverse participants and again found high levels of comprehensibility and inclusivity. We conclude by providing recommendations for questions about gender/sex that are inclusive of all nine locations in the Gender/Sex 3×3 and useful for flexible categorizations of gender/sexes.

It focuses on the city of Leiden in the Netherlands, examining how the city's twinning links with the cities of Torun in Poland and Oxford in the UK have been used at different times as a device to mobilize transnational solidarities with LGBTQ people outside of the Netherlands. Drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews with LGBTQ activists in Leiden as part of a wider study of transnational LGBTQ activism in Europe, I seek to understand how twinning links are used to forge sustainable solidarities both across national boundaries and within Leiden. I suggest that relational comparisons about the status and treatment of sexual dissidents in Leiden and its twin cities are central to the production of these solidarities. While twinning has significant potential as a device for the production of sustainable transnational LGBTQ activism, I also suggest that it can be used to advance problematic geo-temporalities about the relative ‘progressiveness’ or ‘backwardness’ of LGBTQ politics in specific cities.},

In three studies, we assessed the attitudes of U.S. cisgender men and women across sexual orientations (Study 1), heterosexual cisgender men and women (Study 2), cisgender LGB men and women (Study 3), and transgender and gender non-binary individuals across sexual orientations (Study 3) regarding different formats of gender questionnaires. Studies 2 and 3 showed a strong overall preference for the non-binary formats. Across all three studies, preferences for the binary format and objections to the non-binary formats were related to gender-binary beliefs, distinctiveness threat, cisgender and mostly heterosexual male participants, conservative political orientation, and religiosity. These findings suggest that general opposition to utilizing non-binary formats may be influenced by institutionalized binary gender norms and heteronormativity. Across both cisgender and gender-diverse samples, most participants preferred a non-binary gender question format, and gender-diverse individuals overwhelmingly preferred the expanded format. We suggest that those who collect gender data use the expanded format in order to be more inclusive and allow gender-diverse individuals to identify themselves if they choose to do so.},

We retrospectively analysed the prevalence of partial and total neo-vaginal prolapses after sexual reassignment surgery in our institute. During the years, two different techniques have been adopted with the aim of fixing the neovaginal cylinder. In the first, two absorbable sutures are placed at the top of the penoscrotal cylinder and fixed to the Denonvilliers fascia. In the second, two additional sutures are added from the posterior/midpoint of the flap to the prerectal fascia. We enrolled 282 consecutive transsexual patients. 65 (23.04\%) out of the 282 were treated with the first technique and the following 217 (76.96\%) with the last technique. In the first technique, 1 case (1.53\%) of total prolapse and 7 cases (10.76\%) of partial prolapse were observed, while in the other 217 patients treated with the second technique only 9 cases of partial prolapse were observed (4.14\%) and no cases of total prolapse. All prolapses occurred within 6 months from the procedure. In our experience, the use of 4 stitches and a more proximal positioning of the sutures to fix the penoscrotal apex with the Denonvilliers fascia guarantees a lower risk of prolapse.},

	abstract = {Empirical evidence affirms that gender is a nonbinary spectrum. Yet our review of recently published empirical articles reveals that demographic gender measurement in psychology still assumes that gender comprises just two categories: women and men. This common practice is problematic. It fails to represent psychologists' current understanding of gender, violates our ethical principles as scientists, and can result in gender misclassification. Psychologists' reliance on binary measures also conveys an exclusionary attitude that is contrary to recent ethical recommendations and contrary to the growing public concern about transgender rights. We extend five simple, no-cost recommendations that begin to resolve these ethical and methodological problems: use and report, nonbinary gender measures; report the prevalence of nonbinary participants; clarify their inclusion and treatment in analysis; and use gender inclusive language. We also address common concerns expressed by researchers, including whether measuring “sex” resolves the issue and whether gender-inclusive measures confuse or offend participants.},

At a moment before today’s reduction of transgender experiences to spectacles of transitional assimilation, bio-social disorder, and death by dominant—or even authoritarian—white cis-heteropatriarchal culture, Lee’s films gave expression to the gender subversions of trans people of colour and their co-conspirators. In solidarity with Lee’s work, I produce critical creative language about racial transgender social identities. At a current moment offering more abundant critical resources and intersectional transgender movement-building, I also seek to re-harness Lee’s transmasculine imagery towards the trans of colour feminist work of transforming the white Western cis-binary gender/sex system and its perceptual structures. I view the communities represented in Lee’s filmmaking as confronting the contradictions of a post-Civil Rights neoliberal multiculturalism that promises minimal access while institutionalizing white cis-binary formations of gender/sex fundamental to the US nation-state.},

Results: Three novel critiques emerged, including rejection of mental health “recovery” based on participants' identities as “mad,” sexual assault survivors, and/or LGBTQ. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: While a medicalized interpretation of “recovery” may not work for some women, alternative understandings, such as using “recovery” to heal from discrimination and demand systemic changes, have liberatory potential. It is essential that supporters discern and utilize each woman's chosen language. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

This study seeks to broaden current discourse on gender identity measurement in the USA, including measurement adoption challenges and mitigation strategies, thereby allowing for better data collection to understand and address health disparities for people of all genders. Three data sources were used to triangulate findings: expert interviews with gender and sexuality research leaders; key-informant interviews with gender minorities in New Orleans, LA; and document analysis of relevant surveys, guides and commentaries. Ten key dilemmas were identified: 1) moving beyond binary gender construction; 2) conflation of gender, sex and sexual orientation; 3) emerging nature of gender-related language; 4) concerns about item sensitivity; 5) research fatigue among gender minorities; 6) design and analytical limitations; 7) categorical and procedural consistency; 8) pre-populated vs. open-field survey items; 9) potential misclassification; and 10) competing data collection needs. Researchers must continue working toward consensus concerning better practices is gender measurement and be explicit about their methodological choices. The existence of these dilemmas must not impede research on important health issues affecting gender minorities.},

	abstract = {Medical mistrust persists and appears to be growing. The public health literature on medical mistrust has largely focused on mistrust among Black and African American populations due to legacies of abuse and mistreatment, such as the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study. However, research is now emerging that explores mistrust among various populations and in varying contexts, and the literature now largely emphasizes the role of ongoing, present-day social and economic inequalities in shaping and sustaining mistrust, particularly among populations who experience staggering health disparities. This special issue showcased nine articles exploring medical mistrust among diverse populations, exploring a wide array of topics and spanning myriad methodologies. In addition to a rigorous systematic review of the literature, this issue covers several critical subareas of the health disparities literature, including preventative health screenings among Black men, discrimination and cultural factors among rural Latinx communities, health care satisfaction among Latina immigrant women, the complex relationship between HIV testing and “conspiracy beliefs” among Black populations, pre-exposure prophylaxis use among transgender women, the impacts of mass incarceration on HIV care, eHealth interventions to address chronic diseases among sexual minority men of color, and participatory research to engage underserved populations as co-researchers. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief summary of the nine manuscripts in this special issue and to outline some recommendations and future directions for research on medical mistrust.},

To fill this gap, we conducted qualitative interviews with five trans individuals. We found that gender euphoria refers to positive emotions resulting from affirmation of one's gender identity or expression and can include a wide variety of emotions and experiences. Gender euphoria can range from feelings of intense joy accompanying the attainment of milestones in gender transition through to a more consistent sense of calmness and relief occurring later in transition. We contextualize these findings within the gender minority stress model to explore the link between gender euphoria, dysphoria, and health and well-being generally. Our findings emphasize the value of prioritizing euphoria, happiness, and safety in gender-affirming care.},

Although cost effectiveness strategies and best practice lessons recommend targeting specific populations for HIV prevention, existing risk categories lack specificity, and may in fact cause further confusion. Existing categories of risk often perpetuate notions of gender and sexuality that can erroneously exclude, alienate, and stigmatise those who are at the highest risk and thus should be prioritised. We review the troubled history of the MSM category and the problematic conflation of trans feminine individuals and MSM in much of the existing HIV literature, and how this practice has stymied progress in slowing the HIV epidemic in the most at-risk groups, including those who do not fit neatly into binary notions of gender and sex. We draw from examples in the field, specifically among trans feminine people in Beirut and San Francisco, to illustrate the lived experiences of individuals whose identities may not fit into Euro-Atlantic constructs of HIV prevention categories.},

Such deployments are morally contestable, that is, they can be challenged on ethical or political grounds. Two characterizations of “woman” proposed in the feminist literature are critiqued from this perspective. When we consider what would happen to transgender women upon the broad implementation of these characterizations within transgender women's social context, we discover that they suffer from two defects: they either exclude at least some transgender women, or else they implicitly foster hierarchies among women, marginalizing transgender women in particular. In conclusion, I claim that the moral contestability of gender‐term deployments acts as a stimulus to regularly consider the provisionality and revisability of our deployments of the term “woman.”},

Multivariable logistic regression models estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) to examine the correlates of self-reported changes in attractions ever in lifetime among the whole sample (n = 452) and after transition among those who reported social gender transition (n = 205). The sample endorsed diverse sexual orientation identities: 42.7\% queer, 19.0\% other nonbinary, 15.7\% bisexual, 12.2\% straight, and 10.4\% gay/lesbian. Overall, 58.2\% reported having experienced changes in sexual attractions in their lifetime. In adjusted models, trans masculine individuals were more likely than trans feminine individuals to report sexual fluidity in their lifetime (aRR = 1.69; 95\% CI = 1.34, 2.12). Among those who transitioned, 64.6\% reported a change in attractions posttransition, and trans masculine individuals were less likely than trans feminine individuals to report sexual fluidity (aRR = 0.44; 95\% CI = 0.28, 0.69). Heterogeneity of sexual orientation identities and sexual fluidity in attractions are the norm rather than the exception among gender minority people.},

However, the re/production of transsexual appears not only to be a function of how the subject position is represented but also a function of the structure of narrative. If this is so, then the following questions arise: What is the relation between the representation of a subject position in a narrative and the structure of narrative? and how does this relation function in the re/production of transsexual and gender multiplicity? In an analysis of one autobiographical interview, the author reads male-to-female transsexual as a subject position grounded in dichotomous gender that was disrupted only where ambiguity is allowed in the narrative structure, and this disruption was foreclosed through how the subject was represented and/or the structure of the narrative.},

Researchers across disciplines have rejected gender binarism; English dictionaries and style manuals have embraced the singular “they”; and social networking sites offer multiple gender options. These changes signal increased awareness that binary gender categorizations perpetuate structures of oppression that act on all people, but especially disadvantage transgender, non-binary, and intersex individuals. Mindful of this cultural shift, this paper explores how gender measurement is handled in recent scholarly publications in communication. Based on a qualitative content analysis of articles published in 2018–2019, it demonstrates that six leading U.S.-based communication journals published research that marginalizes non-cisnormative people through binary gender measurement. Arguing that it is the ethical responsibility of researchers to recognize the multiplicity of identities that are authentic to our informants, it concludes with recommendations for conceptualizing, measuring, and reporting gender beyond the binary, including a metric for gender that incorporates dual axes of gender identity and gender experience.},

This has serious implications on transgender population health research; an urgent area of study given the systemic discrimination faced by transgender individuals and the resultant social and health inequities. In this precarious political climate, obtaining high-quality data for research is challenging and in recent years, two data sources have formed the foundation of transgender health research in the United States, namely the 2015 United States Transgender Study and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System after the launch of the optional Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Module in 2014. While useful, there are serious challenges to using these data to study transgender health, specifically related to survey weighting methodologies, ascertainment of gender identity, and study design. In this article, we detail these challenges and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches that have been implemented as well as clarify several common errors that exist in the literature. We feel that this contribution is necessary to provide accurate interpretation of the evidence that currently informs policy and priority setting for transgender population health and will provide vital insights for future studies with these now ubiquitous sources of data in the field.},

It is, however, rarely defined what is meant by gender. In this article, we deconstruct the concept ‘gender’ as consisting of several facets, and argue that the researcher needs to identify relevant aspects of gender in relation to their research question. We make a thorough exposition of considerations that the researcher should bear in mind when formulating questions about each facet, in order to exemplify how complex this construct is. We also remind the researcher that gender is not a binary category and discuss challenges in the balance between taking existing gender diversity into account and yet sorting participants into gender categorisations that function in statistical analyzes. To aid in this process, we provide an empirical example on how gender identity may be categorised when using a free-text response. Lastly, we suggest that other measurements than participants’ gender might be better predictors of the outcome variable.},

Any attempt to move beyond binary thinking in gender relations initiates a consideration of multiplicity, and the way in which multiplicity is conceptualized exerts a critical influence on the possibilities that are opened up. This article interrogates existing understandings of multiplicity and finds three actual or possible types - multiplicities of the same, characteristic of feminist approaches which we critique through a reconceptualization of desire; multiplicities of the third, characterized by anthropological, transgender and queer theory approaches; and multiplicities of difference and dispersion, typified by the rhizomatics and fluid theorizing of Deleuze and Guattari, Grosz and Olkowski. We propose an ontology of gender as a creative and productive form of desire, realized as proliferation in Deleuze and Guattari?s model of the rhizome.

The aims of this study were to compare client characteristics at admission to chemical dependency (CD) treatment by sexual orientation, examine sexual orientation as a predictor of co-occurring CD and mental health problems (hereafter referred to as co-occurring disorders [COD]), and to examine the effect of sexual orientation and COD on 1-year CD treatment outcomes (treatment completion, treatment reentry, and arrest) among men and women.

Method:

This retrospective cohort study used 2004–2008 data from publicly funded CD treatment programs in Washington State (n = 69,525 clients). Bivariate comparisons were made using chi-square tests; logistic and Cox regressions were to estimate risk in multivariate analyses.

Results:

Risk factors associated with sexual minority status (lesbian/gay/bisexual) included COD, primary drug (vs. alcohol) use, and greater substance use. In multivariate analyses, sexual minority clients were more than twice as likely as their heterosexual counterparts to have COD. COD, but not sexual orientation, negatively predicted treatment completion and arrest overall in the year following treatment among male and female clients and positively predicted treatment reentry and intimate partner violence–related arrest among women. COD moderated the effect of sexual orientation on arrest; gay men with COD were less likely to be arrested, particularly for substance use and other violence–related crimes.

Conclusions:

These findings highlight the importance of assessing mental health among sexual minority clients in treatment settings and addressing issues specific to both female and male sexual minorities.},

The study recruited a convenience sample of 50 people (25 trans and 25 cis) from the general population of Cleveland and Akron, OH. The study used cognitive interviewing methods with scripted, semi-structured and spontaneous probes when appropriate. Participants were asked to read questions out-loud, answer the questions, and explain why they answered the way they did. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed prior to analysis. The gender status questions were found to be easy to use and understood by both trans and cis participants. The two-question gender status measure was able to encompass a diversity of identities within a trans sample and be consistently answered by the study’s cis participants. The measures were able to differentiate between trans and cis groups. The two-step gender measure can be a useful tool in examining gender diversity within general population studies.},

One pressing area where gaps and inequities are apparent is transgender (trans) people’s access to gender-affirming medicine such as hormones and surgeries. Reasons for the dire state of care include education gaps. While specific content knowledge has been identified as lacking in medical school curricula, less research has focused on the complex social practices required of clinicians and educators working in gender-affirming medicine, and how these skills are learned through practice. In order to inform health professions education in this key area of need, we conducted a study to better understand the social practices, and the learning that occurs therein, of gender-affirming medicine. We identified the work processes of 22 clinicians, clinician-educators, trans patients, and clinical care administrators with attention to how policies and protocols influenced practice, learning, and teaching. The results of our study elucidate: (1) that practicing of gender-affirming medicine is strictly dictated by standardized assessment protocols, which serve as a form of curriculum; and (2) how health professionals learn and teach health advocacy as a form of resistance to protocols identified as creating inequities. These findings suggest an opportunity to view protocols—and their inherent limitations—more deliberately as teaching and learning tools, specifically for learning advocacy.},

The objectives of this study were to: (1) increase access to trans research; (2) map and describe trans research across subject fields; and (3) identify evidence gaps and opportunities for more responsible research. Eligibility criteria were established to include empirical research of any design, which included trans participants or their personal information and that was published in English in peer-reviewed journals. A search of 15 academic databases resulted in 25,230 references; data presented include 690 trans-focused articles that met the screening criteria and were published between 2010 and 2014. The 10 topics studied most frequently were: (1) therapeutics and surgeries; (2) gender identity and expression; (3) mental health; (4) biology and physiology; (5) discrimination and marginalization; (6) physical health; (7) sexual health, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections; (8) health and mental health services; (9) social support, relationships, and families; and (10) resilience, well-being, and quality of life. This map also highlights the relatively minor attention that has been paid to a number of study topics, including ethnicity, culture, race, and racialization; housing; income; employment; and space and place. Results of this review have the potential to increase awareness of existing trans research, to characterize evidence gaps, and to inform strategic research prioritization. With this information, it is more likely that trans communities and allies will be in a position to benefit from existing research and to hold researchers accountable.},

A 24-item survey gathered information on gender and sexual orientation, smoking status, and questions assessing behaviors and preferences related to smoke-free policies.The project recruited participants through Pride Festivals (n = 2,676) and Web-based surveys (n = 231) representing numerous sexual and gender orientations and the racial composite of the state of Missouri. Differences were found between the Pride Festivals sample and the Web-based sample, including smoking rates, with current smoking for the Web-based sample (22\%) significantly less than the Pride Festivals sample (37\%; p \&lt; .0001). The SGM group (n = 2,162) was 1.49 times more likely to be current smokers compared with the study's heterosexual group (n = 436; p = .005). Statistically fewer SGM racial minorities (33\%) are current smokers compared with SGM Whites (37\%; p = .04). Support and preferences for public and private smoke-free environments were generally low in the SGM population.The strategic targeting method achieved a large and diverse sample. The findings of high rates of smoking coupled with generally low levels of support for smoke-free public policies in the SGM community highlight the need for additional research to inform programmatic attempts to reduce tobacco use and increase support for smoke-free environments.},

In this article, we discuss ways in which public health researchers can use sex and gender terms correctly and center the health experiences of intersex, transgender, nonbinary, and agender individuals. This includes promoting sensitivity in approaching sex and gender minority communities, improving survey questions, and collaborating with GSM communities to improve research quality and participant experiences. Improving our standards for the quality of sex and gender term usage and centering sex and gender minorities in public health research are imperative to addressing the health inequalities faced by sex and gender minorities.},

	abstract = {Although medical case reports have fallen out of favor in the era of the impact factor, there is a long tradition of using case reports for teaching and discovery. Some evidence indicates that writing case reports might improve medical students’ critical thinking and writing skills and help prepare them for future scholarly work. From 2009 through 2015, students participating in the case reporting program at a VA hospital produced 250+ case reports, 35 abstracts, and 15 journal publications. Here, three medical students who published their case reports comment on what they learned from the experience. On the basis of their comments, the authors propose five educational benefits of case reporting: observation and pattern recognition skills; hypothesis-generating skills; understanding of patient-centered care; rhetorical versatility; and use of the case report as a rapidly publishable “mini-thesis,” which could fulfill MD thesis or scholarly concentration requirements. The authors discuss the concept of the case report as a “hybrid narrative” with simultaneous medical and humanistic significance, and its potential use to teach students about their dual roles as engaged listeners and scientists. Finally, the authors consider the limitations and pitfalls of case reports, including patient confidentiality issues, overinterpretation, emphasis on the rare, and low initial publication rates. Case reports allow students to contribute to medical literature, learn useful scholarly skills, and participate in a tradition that links them with past generations of physicians. The authors conclude that the case report can be an effective teaching tool with a broad range of potential educational benefits.},

Reckoning with the reality that today the global response to HIV has failed to respond to the needs of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, and transgender persons, we turn our attention to processes and practices of categorisation and classification, and the entanglement of the multiple social worlds that constitute our understanding of each of these categories and people within the categories.

	abstract = {Introduction Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a remarkable biomedical advance to prevent HIV, ongoing research on PrEP contributes to and interacts with a legacy of HIV experimentation on marginalized communities in resource-limited settings. This paper explores the complexity of PrEP research mistrust among Peruvian transgender (trans) women who completed a PrEP adherence intervention and those who refused participation (i.e. declined to enrol, voluntarily withdrew, and/or were lost to follow-up). Methods Data were derived from 86 trans women (mean age 29 years) participants in the formative (four focus groups (n = 32), 20 interviews) and the evaluation stages (34 interviews) of a social network-based PrEP intervention for trans women in Lima, Peru. The formative stage took place from May to July 2015, while the evaluative stage took place from April to May 2018. Audio files were transcribed verbatim and analysed via an immersion crystallization approach using Dedoose (v.6.1.18). Results Three paradoxes of trans women’s participation in PrEP science as a “key” population emerged as amplifying mistrust: (1) increases in PrEP research targeting trans women but limited perceived improvements in HIV outcomes; (2) routine dismissal by research physicians and staff of PrEP-related side effects and the social realities of taking PrEP, resulting in questions about who PrEP research is really for and (3) persistent limitations on PrEP access for trans women despite increasing involvement in clinical trials, fostering feelings of being a “guinea pig” to advance PrEP science. Conclusions Findings highlight the wisdom inherent in PrEP mistrust as a reflection of trans women’s experiences that underscore the broken bonds of trust between communities, researchers and the research enterprise. PrEP mistrust is amplified through perceived paradoxes that suggest to trans women that they are key experimental participants but not target PrEP users outside of research settings. Findings highlight the urgent need to reframe mistrust not as a characteristic of trans women to be addressed through education and outreach, but as a systemic institutional- and industry-level problem replicated, manifested and ultimately to be corrected, through global HIV science.},

The gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered (GLBT) population is a good example of a demographic group that has been understudied because it is difficult to develop a subsample of sufficient size from typical national samples. Here we exploit the extraordinary size of a 2006 online election day survey (with about 35,000 respondents) to examine how the GLBT community behaves politically. While it will surprise no one that this community bestowed little support on Stephen Harper's Conservative party in the 2006 federal election, the factors behind such a consistent vote pattern are not adequately understood. In order to shed more light on the voting behaviour of the GLBT electorate, we develop a socio-demographic profile of the group, and explore three explanatory angles: 1) salience of issue campaign dynamics, given that the same-sex marriage issue was prominent in 2006; 2) ideological and attitudinal proclivities; and 3) strategic considerations.Résumé.

Bien qu'il ne surprendra personne que cette communauté accordé peu d'appui sur Parti conservateur de Stephen Harper lors de l'élection fédérale de 2006, les facteurs qui expliquent un tel motif ne sont pas bien compris. Afin de jeter plus de lumière sur le comportement de vote de l'électorat GLBT, nous développons un profil sociodémographique de cette groupe, et d'explorer trois angles explicatives: 1) pertinence de la question du mariage de même sexe, 2) tendances idéologiques, et 3) des considérations stratégiques.},

However, many gaps still exist in this area, including identifying how TGD people would like to see their gender represented in questions about gender identity. To address this issue, we explored the perspectives of TGD people regarding the construction of questions about gender.

Methods: In this online study of 695 TGD people (Mage = 25.52), participants provided written suggestions for how to ask about gender and these responses were analyzed thematically. Data were collected between fall 2015 and summer 2017.

Results: Three broad categories of responses emerged: (1) specific identities to include in response options; (2) specific questions to ask about gender; and (3) qualifiers/nuanced considerations.

Conclusion: Participants provided a variety of suggestions for how to ask about gender and future research is needed to explore the implementation of these suggestions. Recommendations are provided for options that researchers can explore for how to ask about gender. These findings highlight the ways that TGD people would like their gender to be asked about, which is necessary information to ensure that questions about gender reflect TGD people's identities accurately.},

A barrier to monitoring the health and well-being of transgender people is the lack of inclusion of measures to assess natal sex/gender identity status in surveys. Data were from a cross-sectional anonymous online survey of members (n {\textgreater} 36,000) of a sexual networking website targeting men who have sex with men in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries/territories in Latin America/the Caribbean, Portugal, and Spain. Natal sex/gender identity status was assessed using a two-step method (Step 1: assigned birth sex, Step 2: current gender identity). Male-to-female (MTF) and female-to-male (FTM) participants were compared to non-transgender males in age-adjusted regression models on socioeconomic status (SES) (education, income, sex work), masculine gender conformity, psychological health and well-being (lifetime suicidality, past-week depressive distress, positive self-worth, general self-rated health, gender related stressors), and sexual health (HIV-infection, past-year STIs, past-3 month unprotected anal or vaginal sex). The two-step method identified 190 transgender participants (0.54 \%; 158 MTF, 32 FTM). Of the 12 health-related variables, six showed significant differences between the three groups: SES, masculine gender conformity, lifetime suicidality, depressive distress, positive self-worth, and past-year genital herpes. A two-step approach is recommended for health surveillance efforts to assess natal sex/gender identity status. Cognitive testing to formally validate assigned birth sex and current gender identity survey items in Spanish and Portuguese is encouraged.},

        This article describes methodological challenges, gaps, and opportunities in US transgender health research.
        Recent findings 
        Lack of large prospective observational studies and intervention trials, limited data on risks and benefits of sex affirmation (e.g., hormones and surgical interventions), and inconsistent use of definitions across studies hinder evidence-based care for transgender people. Systematic high-quality observational and intervention-testing studies may be carried out using several approaches, including general population-based, health systems-based, clinic-based, venue-based, and hybrid designs. Each of these approaches has its strength and limitations; however, harmonization of research efforts is needed. Ongoing development of evidence-based clinical recommendations will benefit from a series of observational and intervention studies aimed at identification, recruitment, and follow-up of transgender people of different ages, from different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and with diverse gender identities.
        Summary 
        Transgender health research faces challenges that include standardization of lexicon, agreed upon population definitions, study design, sampling, measurement, outcome ascertainment, and sample size. Application of existing and new methods is needed to fill existing gaps, increase the scientific rigor and reach of transgender health research, and inform evidence-based prevention and care for this underserved population.},

Four participants reported having sex with men and women during the past three months; two participants self-identified as male-to-female transgender. Qualitative themes that emerged included a lack of accurate information about HIV and prevention; the influence of social-political contexts to sexual risk; and barriers to healthcare services. We also identified eight characteristics of potentially effective interventions for HIV prevention. Our findings suggest that socio-political contexts must be additional targets of change to reduce and eliminate HIV health disparities experienced by immigrant Latino men who have sex with men.},

The association between bacterial biofilms of removed implants and capsular contracture was investigated.Breast implants explanted between 2006 and 2010 at five participating centres for plastic and reconstructive surgery were investigated by sonication. Bacterial cultures derived from sonication were correlated with patient, surgical and implant characteristics, and the degree of capsular contracture.The study included 121 breast implants from 84 patients, of which 119 originated from women and two from men undergoing gender reassignment. Some 50 breast prostheses were implanted for reconstruction, 48 for aesthetic reasons and 23 implants were used as temporary expander devices. The median indwelling time was 4·0 (range 0·1–32) years for permanent implants and 3 (range 1–6) months for temporary devices. Excluding nine implants with clinical signs of infection, sonication cultures were positive in 40 (45 per cent) of 89 permanent implants and in 12 (52 per cent) of 23 temporary devices. Analysis of permanent implants showed that a positive bacterial culture after sonication correlated with the degree of capsular contracture: Baker I, two of 11 implants; Baker II, two of ten; Baker III, nine of 23; and Baker IV, 27 of 45 (P \&lt; 0·001). The most frequent organisms were Propionibacterium acnes (25 implants) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (21).Sonication cultures correlated with the degree of capsular contracture, indicating the potential causative role of bacterial biofilms in the pathogenesis of capsular contracture.

	abstract = {Transgender (heretofore shortened to ?trans?) people remain largely excluded from involvement and leadership in the research conducted with their communities. As a result, few trans insiders (i.e. trans people who are also researchers) are ever in the position of designing, conducting, and disseminating knowledge from trans research. As such, social narratives of trans experiences are often inaccurate, lacking nuance, or directly damaging. This paper argues that insider?outsider IO research exists on a value ?staircase?, moving from no involvement to full leadership. Using this staircase model, the researchers suggest that elevating and empowering trans people to consult in, conduct, and lead trans research benefits both the trans and research communities. Meaningful trans involvement in research provides more in-depth data, builds more constructive rapport with community members, and produces more effective research than the norm of purely outsider research in the field. The paper then details the results from a study of 6 trans women?s experience of undergoing IO-led trans research, with Shoshana as the main researcher and interviewer. The study identified three main themes: ?The Impact of Trans-Led Research,? ?Constructive Approaches to the Research Process,? and ?Community-Controlled Narratives as a Priority?. This paper concludes that IO-led research facilitates an empowering research process for participants, communities, and researchers, and that future research in the area should consider trans representation and control as a priority.},

Non-binary people regularly have to interact with them, though many do not offer non-binary gender options. This results in non-binary individuals having to either choose an incorrect gender category or refrain from using a site or service—which is occasionally infeasible (e.g., when accessing health services). We tested five different forms through a survey with binary and non-binary participants (n = 350) in three contexts—a digital health form, a social media website, and a dating app. Our results indicate that the majority of participants found binary “male or female” forms exclusive and uncomfortable to fill out across all contexts. We conclude with design considerations for improving gender input forms and consequently their underlying gender model in databases. Our work aims to sensitize designers of (online) gender web forms to the needs and desires of non-binary people.},

Very little research has examined the experience of these veterans when receiving care at VA health care facilities. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences, beliefs, and preferences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) veterans in their communication with VA health care providers. LGBT veterans (n = 58) participated in focus groups or individual interviews and completed self-report measures at two southern VA hospitals. Approximately 2/3 of veterans report that none of their VA providers have specifically asked about their sexual orientation, and 24\% of the veterans indicate that they have not disclosed their orientation to any VA provider. Although some veterans want providers to initiate these discussions, veterans also expressed fears about disclosure and its possible negative consequences. Similarly, LGBT veterans report varied opinions about the appropriateness of routine assessment of minority status. Only 28\% of these veterans experience VA as welcoming to them as LGBT veterans. Systematic training is needed for all VA providers about the rationale for assessing sexual and gender orientation. Staff education should include specific skills for initiating these assessments, and ways of responding to veteran concerns about discussing this topic in the VA health care system.

Community groups are establishing ethics review processes to determine whether and how research is conducted in their communities. To strengthen the ethics review of community-engaged research, we sought to identify and describe these processes.

Methods. In 2008 we conducted an online survey of US-based community groups and community–institutional partnerships involved in human-participants research. We identified 109 respondents who met participation criteria and had ethics review processes in place.

Results. The respondents' processes mainly functioned through community–institutional partnerships, community-based organizations, community health centers, and tribal organizations. These processes had been created primarily to ensure that the involved communities were engaged in and directly benefited from research and were protected from research harms. The primary process benefits included giving communities a voice in determining which studies were conducted and ensuring that studies were relevant and feasible, and that they built community capacity. The primary process challenges were the time and resources needed to support the process.

Conclusions. Community-based processes for ethics review consider community-level ethical issues that institution-based IRBs often do not.},

To address what we term a joy deficit in sociology, we analyze 40 in-depth interviews with trans people in which they were asked what they find joyful about being trans. Their responses demonstrate the methodological and theoretical importance of asking about joy. Four main themes emerged from the interviews. First, interviewees easily answered the question about joy. Second, contrary to common assumptions, we found that transgender people expressed joy in being members of a marginalized group and said that they preferred being transgender. Third, embracing a marginalized identity caused the quality of their lives to improve, increasing self-confidence, body positivity, and sense of peace. Finally, being from a marginalized group facilitated meaningful connections with other people. Our findings demonstrate a vital need to address the joy deficit that exists in the sociological scholarship on transgender people specifically, and marginalized groups more generally. Bridging the sociology of knowledge and narratives, we show how accentuating joy offers nuance to understandings of the lived experiences of marginalized people that has been absent from much of sociological scholarship.},

Using a phenomenological research tradition and a feminist, intersectionality (intercategorical) theoretical framework, the research question guiding the study was: “What are the daily lived experiences of resilience transgender youth of color describe as they negotiate intersections of transprejudice and racism?” The researchers’ individuated findings included five major domains of the essence of participants’ daily lived experiences of resilience despite experiencing racism and transprejudice: (1) evolving, simultaneous self-definition of racial/ethnic and gender identities, (2) being aware of adultism experiences, (3) self-advocacy in educational systems, (4) finding one’s place in the LGBTQQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning) youth community, and (5) use of social media to affirm one’s identities as a transgender youth of color. Implications for practice, research, and advocacy, in addition to the study’s limitations are discussed.},

Measuring these risk factors then becomes crucial for movement forward in victimology. Recent research suggests the increasing need to measure the concepts of sex assigned at birth, gender identity, and sexual identity, all of whom have been linked to risk of victimization. However, it remains to be seen how these concepts are currently being measured, how their measurement has evolved, and if these concepts are being measured regularly, especially in large-scale national data efforts. This study seeks to examine the changes, or lack thereof, in measurement of the concepts of sex, gender identity, and sexual identity in seven major social surveys used in victimology research. Changes to wording, responses, and the number of questions regarding each of these concepts is discussed along with suggestions for improving measurement and implications for victimization research.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
        Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) pre-exposure prophylaxis decreases sexual acquisition of HIV infection. We sought to evaluate the renal safety of TDF in HIV-uninfected persons.
        Design and methods: 
        The Iniciativa Profilaxis Pre-Exposición (iPrEx) study randomly assigned 2499 HIV-seronegative men and transgender women who have sex with men (MSM) to receive oral daily TDF coformulated with emtricitabine (FTC/TDF) or placebo. Serum creatinine and phosphorus during randomized treatment and after discontinuation were measured, and creatinine clearance (CrCl) was estimated by the Cockcroft–Gault equation. Indicators of proximal renal tubulopathy (fractional excretion of phosphorus and uric acid, urine protein, and glucose) were measured in a substudy.
        Results: 
        There was a small but statistically significant decrease in CrCl from baseline in the active arm, compared to placebo, which was first observed at week 4 (mean change: −2.4 vs. −1.1 ml/min; P = 0.02), persisted through the last on-treatment visit (mean change: +0.3 vs. +1.8 ml/min; P = 0.02), and resolved after stopping pre-exposure prophylaxis (mean change: −0.1 vs. 0.0 ml/min; P = 0.83). The effect was confirmed when stratifying by drug detection. The effect of FTC/TDF on CrCl did not vary by race, age, or history of hypertension. There was no difference in serum phosphate trends between the treatment arms. In the substudy, two participants receiving placebo had indicators of tubulopathy.
        Conclusions: 
        In HIV-seronegative MSM, randomization to FTC/TDF was associated with a very mild nonprogressive decrease in CrCl that was reversible and managed with routine serum creatinine monitoring.},

Furthermore, sexual minority students, and particularly those identifying as bisexual, at rural campuses in the United States may experience additional struggles because of their environment. The authors undertook this study in an attempt to understand the challenges facing LGB students as they transition to college life on rural campuses. A small, exploratory sample of 56 sexual minority participants attending rural colleges in the United States provided data on measures of college adjustment. Using content analysis of qualitative data and correlational analysis of quantitative data, the following themes emerged: challenges making new friends, difficulty with roommates, and when or whether to disclose sexual orientation. Comparisons between sexual minorities (bisexual to homosexual) were also conducted to explore the unique experiences of bisexual individuals.},

Current sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) questions do not sufficiently engage SGM people, and there is a critical gap in understanding how SOGI questions reduce inclusion and accurate empirical representation. We conducted a qualitative study to answer the question, “For SGM people, what are the major limitations with current SOGI questions?” Focus groups probed reactions to SOGI questions adapted from prior national surveys and clinical best practice guidelines. Questions were refined and presented in semi-structured cognitive interviews. Template analysis using a priori themes guided analysis. There were 74 participants: 55 in nine focus groups and 19 in cognitive interviews. Participants were diverse: 51.3\% identified as gender minorities, 87.8\% as sexual minorities, 8.1\% as Hispanic/Latinx, 13.5\% as Black or African-American, and 43.2\% as Non-white. Two major themes emerged: (1) SOGI questions did not allow for identity fluidity and complexity, reducing inclusion and representation, and (2) SOGI question stems and answer choices were often not clear as to which SOGI dimension was being assessed. To our knowledge, this represents the largest body of qualitative data studying SGM perspectives when responding to SOGI questions. We present recommendations for future development and use of SOGI measures. Attention to these topics may improve meaningful participation of SGM people in research and implementation of such research within and for SGM communities.},

	abstract = {Background: This article is by a group of trans and nonbinary researchers and experts in the field of trans health who have conducted an analysis of trans health research needs.Aims: To highlight topics that need further research and to outline key considerations for those conducting research in our field.Methods: The first author conducted semi-structured interviews with all coauthors, and these were used to create a first draft of this manuscript. This draft was circulated to all authors, with edits made until consensus was reached among the authors.Results: More comprehensive long-term research that centers trans people’s experiences is needed on the risks and benefits of gender affirming hormones and surgeries. The trans health research field also needs to have a broader focus beyond medical transition or gender affirmation, including general health and routine healthcare; trans people’s lives without, before, and after medical gender affirmation; and sexuality, fertility, and reproductive healthcare needs. More research is also needed on social determinants of health, including ways to make healthcare settings and other environments safer and more supportive; social and legal gender recognition; the needs of trans people who are most marginalized; and the ways in which healing happens within trans communities. The second part of this article highlights key considerations for researchers, the foremost being acknowledging trans community expertise and centering trans community members’ input into research design and interpretation of findings, in advisory and/or researcher roles. Ethical considerations include maximizing benefits and minimizing harms (beneficence) and transparency and accountability to trans communities. Finally, we note the importance of conferences, grant funding, working with students, and multidisciplinary teams.Discussion: This article outlines topics and issues needing further consideration to make the field of trans health research more responsive to the needs of trans people.

(Wilchins, 2002: 29)IntroductionAmong non-binary people, there is a vast heterogeneity of experiences and self-conceptualisations. Despite such differences, a striking commonality was observed among participants: insecurity in relation to gender. This could manifest as an internal uncertainty over whether one was ‘trans enough’, or fear of not being seen as trans enough by other people. This chapter will explore this phenomenon, while considering how hegemonic gendered expectations affect not only the ability to socially exert, but to internally formulate a non-binary gender identity. This exploration cuts across the original research questions, as feelings of insecurity were manifested in relation to experiences of queer community interaction, everyday experiences and accessing (or concern over accessing) medical support. Further, introspection was, perhaps predictably, strongly influenced by societal gender norms (both within and outside queer communities), which could be internalised, resisted, or both simultaneously.I begin by highlighting how non-binary people who had not accessed gender-affirming medical services could view those who had as ‘more legitimate’ than themselves, even if they did not want such access. Critically, participants didn't view others who weren't medically transitioning as less legitimate. Rather, they held themselves to different standards of validity, highlighting how the anxiety of ‘realness’ often operated at the level of the self. Participants were self-aware and critical of such feelings as problematic. This may be suggestive of difficulties with, or low self-esteem in relation to, gender identity (Neff, 2003).I then argue that hegemonic medicalised narratives of what it ‘means to be transgender’ have shaped queer community interactions. I show how community tensions can manifest with regards to non-binary people being made to feel ‘not trans enough’ by other members of trans communities. Binary-oriented trans people could sometimes exhibit hostility towards particular identities, or construct implicit hierarchies of legitimacy in order to self-validate. Such practices serve to evidence the problematic nature of processes where trans/non-binary identities are often only validated (by doctors, the law, family or friends, or in day-to-day social interactions) once difficult or painful processes have been navigated or performed.},

	abstract = {Accurate data collection from LGBTIQ+ communities is crucial for public health research and the provision of equitable services. Emergent fluid, multiple, trans and non-binary gender identities complicate data collection in ways that make an excellent case-study for rethinking the categorization of such data. In this article, we explore some of the obstacles to collecting data from trans, gender-diverse and non-binary (TGD) communities, and the difficulties in synthesizing meaning about fluid or multiple identity categories. We review a selection of international surveys from the last 10 years and then present a case-study of data collection in an Australian mixed-methods study of LGBTQ+ young people’s uses of social media. In doing so we draw upon trans and gender diverse people’s lived experiences to reinterpret our survey dataset in which responses that ‘refused categorisation’ were initially removed. We argue that theorizing the ‘social life of data’ – that is analysing the disciplinary orientation and purpose of research, while also acknowledging the moment and site of data collection, the methods used, and the mutable meanings in play – better accounts for the lived experiences of gender beyond binary and static identities.},

The survey was anonymous and youth were recruited from LGBTQ-specific listservs and venues as well as through social networking sites as a way of reaching youth often not represented in LGBTQ surveys. Youth highly endorsed many types of services, settings, and modes of delivery. Some subgroup differences emerged. Transgender youth and those uncertain about their gender identity expressed stronger interest than others in services to address stress, family issues, and self-defense, and in receiving support and guidance from LGBTQ adults. Few differences in service preferences along demographic lines such as race/ethnicity emerged; however, African American youth were more likely than others to prefer services offered in a place of worship. Contrary to predictions, geographic and community variables were not related to service type, delivery format, or location preferences.},

	abstract = {Recently, scholars and activists have turned their attention toward improving the measurement of sex and gender in survey research. The focus of this effort has been on including answer options beyond ?male? and ?female? to questions about the respondent?s gender. This is an important step toward both reflecting the diversity of gendered lives and better aligning survey measurement practice with contemporary gender theory. However, our systematic examination of questionnaires, manuals, and other technical materials from four of the largest and longest-running surveys in the United States indicates that there are a number of other issues with how gender is conceptualized and measured in social surveys that also deserve attention, including essentialist practices that treat sex and gender as synonymous, easily determined by others, obvious, and unchanging over the life course. We find that these understandings extend well beyond direct questions about the respondent?s gender, permeating the surveys. A hyper-gendered world of ?males? and ?females,? ?brothers? and ?sisters,? and ?husbands? and ?wives? shapes what we can see in survey data. If not altered, surveys will continue to reproduce statistical representations that erase important dimensions of variation and likely limit understanding of the processes that perpetuate social inequality.},

In a multi-site study, data were obtained from 294 individuals who consumed alcohol during the past year. The results indicated that 72.3\% of men and 62.4\% of women engaged in hazardous and harmful alcohol use and 50.8\% of men and 48.7\% of women met criteria for past-year alcohol dependence. The most common types of childhood maltreatment were physical abuse among male drinkers (62.7\%) and emotional abuse (71.8\%) among female drinkers. Men and women reported high percentages of out-of-home placement (39\% and 47\%, respectively). Logistic multiple regressions found that for male drinkers boarding school attendance and foster care placement were significant predictors of past-year alcohol dependence. For female drinkers, being adopted was significantly associated with a decreased risk of past-year drinking binge or spree. Dose-response relationships, using number of childhood exposures as a predictor, were not significant. The results highlight the need for alcohol and violence prevention and intervention strategies among urban  two-spirit individuals.},
