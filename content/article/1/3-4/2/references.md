- abstract: This article explores different conceptualizations of, and
    debates about, Body Integrity Identity Disorder and Gender Identity
    Disorder to first examine how these "identity disorders" have been
    both linked to and distinguished from, the "sexual disorders" of
    apotemnophilia (the desire to amputate healthy limbs) and
    autogynephilia (the desire to perceive oneself as a woman). We argue
    that distinctions between identity disorders and sexual disorders or
    paraphilias reflect a troubling hierarchy in medical, social and
    political discourses between "legitimate" desires to transition or
    modify bodies (those based in identity claims) and "illegitimate"
    desires (those based in sexual desire or sexuality). This article
    secondly and more broadly explores how this hierarchy between
    "identity troubles" and paraphilias is rooted in a sex-negative,
    ableist, and cisnormative society, that makes it extremely difficult
    for activists, individuals, medical professionals, ethicists and
    anyone else, to conceptualize or understand the desires that some
    people express around transforming their bodies---whether the
    transformation relates to sex, gender or ability. We argue that
    instead of seeking to "explain" these desires in ways that further
    pathologize the people articulating them, we need to challenge the
    ableism and cisnormativity that require explanations for some
    bodies, subjectivities and desires while leaving dominant normative
    bodies and subjectivities intact. We thus end the article by
    exploring possibilities for forging connections between trans
    studies and critical disability studies that would open up options
    for listening and responding to the claims of transabled people.

- abstract: Drawing on an integrated theoretical lens of vocabularies of
    motive, gender interactionism, and queer theory, the authors explore
    how eighteen lesbian mothers and twenty-two gay fathers negotiate
    the cultural narratives of heteronormativity and gender essentialism
    as they imagine and participate in constructing their children's
    gender. Findings highlight the extent to which participants'
    parenting fantasies and realities occur within a context of
    heightened gender accountability that they manage for their
    children. The authors show how the practice of securing gender role
    models for their children is one way that non-heterosexual parents
    manage this accountability. Next, the authors introduce "queer
    ruptures" in participants' narratives and detail the subtle ways
    that they destabilize the existing heteronormative gender order.
    Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for empirical
    and theoretical development.

- annote: What do you do when your son announces he is transgender and
    asks that you call her by a new name? Or what if your child uses a
    term you've never heard of to describe themselves (neutrois,
    agender, non-binary, genderqueer, androgyne\...) and when you didn't
    know what they meant, they left the room and now won't speak to you
    about it? Perhaps your daughter recently asked you not to use
    gendered pronouns when referring to 'her' anymore, preferring that
    you use \"they\"; you're left wondering if this is just a phase, or
    if there's something more that you need to understand about your
    child. There is a generational divide in our understandings of
    gender. This comprehensive guidebook helps to bridge that divide by
    exploring the unique challenges that thousands of families face
    every day raising a teenager who may be transgender, non-binary,
    gender-fluid or otherwise gender-expansive. Combining years of
    experience working in the field with extensive research and personal
    interviews, the authors cover pressing concerns relating to physical
    and emotional development, social and school pressures, medical
    considerations, and family communications. Learn how parents can
    more deeply understand their children, and raise their non-binary or
    transgender adolescent with love and compassion. -- Provided by

- abstract: Drawing on qualitative interviews with parents of preschool
    children, the author addresses parental responses to children's
    gender nonconformity. The author's analyses indicate that parents
    welcome what they perceive as gender nonconformity among their young
    daughters, while their responses in relation to sons are more
    complex. Many parents across racial and class backgrounds accept or
    encourage some tendencies they consider atypical for boys. But this
    acceptance is balanced by efforts to approximate hegemonic ideals of
    masculinity. The author considers these patterns in the context of
    gender as an interactional accomplishment, demonstrating that
    parents are often consciously aware of their own role in
    accomplishing gender with and for their sons. Heterosexual fathers
    are especially likely to be motivated in that accomplishment work by
    their own personal endorsement of hegemonic masculinity, while
    heterosexual mothers and gay parents are more likely to be motivated
    by accountability to others in relation to those ideals.

- abstract: "Conflict with the family about sexual orientation and
    gender diversity is a key risk factor associated with poor mental
    health in youth populations. Findings presented here derive from a
    UK study that employed an interdisciplinary critical mental health
    approach that de-pathologised emotional distress and conceptualised
    families as social and affective units that are created through
    everyday practices. Our aim was to explore how family relationships
    foster, maintain or harm the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ+
    youth. Data were generated through exploratory visual, creative and
    digital qualitative methods in two phases. Phase 1 involved
    digital/paper emotion maps and interviews with LGBTQ+ youth aged 16
    to 25 (n = 12) and family member/mentor interviews (n = 7). Phase 2
    employed diary methods and follow-up interviews (n = 9). The data
    analytic strategy involved three stages: individual case analysis,
    cross-sectional thematic analysis and meta-interpretation. We found
    that family relationships impacted queer youth mental health in
    complex ways that were related to the establishment of their
    autonomous queer selves, the desire to remain belonging to their
    family and the need to maintain a secure environment. The emotion
    work involved in navigating identity, belonging and security was
    made difficult because of family heteronormativity, youth autonomy
    and family expectations, and had a stark impact on queer youth
    mental health and well-being. Improving the mental health of LGBTQ+
    youth requires a much deeper understanding of the emotionality of
    family relationships and the difficulties negotiating these as a
    young person."

- abstract: "Recent years have seen a substantial change in how children
    who challenge gender norms (referred to in this article as \"Gender
    Independent\") are regarded by professionals, by their families and
    by the public at large. Pathologized and treated for decades as a
    mental illness, childhood gender non-conformity would seem to be
    imbued with new meaning, as evidenced by a growing number of public
    voices claiming gender variance as part of human diversity. Call it
    a paradigm shift: from disorder to diversity, from treatment to
    affirmation, from pathology to pride, from cure to community. This
    commentary article reflects on recent shifts in language, shifts in
    identity options, and shifts in the focus of intervention with
    gender non-conforming children. Drawing on existing research and
    public discourse, I consider what the field of human sexuality can
    learn from \"Gender Independence.\""

- abstract: As a traditionally underserved population that faces
    numerous health disparities, youth who identify as transgender and
    gender diverse (TGD) and their families are increasingly presenting
    to pediatric providers for education, care, and referrals. The need
    for more formal training, standardized treatment, and research on
    safety and medical outcomes often leaves providers feeling ill
    equipped to support and care for patients that identify as TGD and
    families. In this policy statement, we review relevant concepts and
    challenges and provide suggestions for pediatric providers that are
    focused on promoting the health and positive development of youth
    that identify as TGD while eliminating discrimination and stigma.

- abstract: Abstract In accounting for their experiences of having a
    transgender child, cisgender parents often make recourse to a trope
    of loss to account for their journeys. A focus on loss is also
    evident in guides for parents and academic writing. In this article,
    the authors seek to produce an alternative account of loss, one that
    shifts the focus away from transgender children themselves and onto
    the broader context in which parents and their transgender children
    live, with a particular focus on schools. Specifically, the authors
    consider how cisgenderism produces a loss of certitude for parents,
    in that parents lose the invisible privileges that accrue to those
    who occupy an unmarked place within the cisgender norm. To do this,
    the authors draw on survey data from sixty Australian cisgender
    parents of transgender children, exploring specifically how they
    spoke about experiences with schools, both negative and positive.

- abstract: "The concept of hegemonic masculinity has influenced gender
    studies across many academic fields but has also attracted serious
    criticism. The authors trace the origin of the concept in a
    convergence of ideas in the early 1980s and map the ways it was
    applied when research on men and masculinities expanded. Evaluating
    the principal criticisms, the authors defend the underlying concept
    of masculinity, which in most research use is neither reified nor
    essentialist. However, the criticism of trait models of gender and
    rigid typologies is sound. The treatment of the subject in research
    on hegemonic masculinity can be improved with the aid of recent
    psychological models, although limits to discursive flexibility must
    be recognized. The concept of hegemonic masculinity does not equate
    to a model of social reproduction; we need to recognize social
    struggles in which subordinated masculinities influence dominant
    forms. Finally, the authors review what has been confirmed from
    early formulations (the idea of multiple masculinities, the concept
    of hegemony, and the emphasis on change) and what needs to be
    discarded (onedimensional treatment of hierarchy and trait
    conceptions of gender). The authors suggest reformulation of the
    concept in four areas: a more complex model of gender hierarchy,
    emphasizing the agency of women; explicit recognition of the
    geography of masculinities, emphasizing the interplay among local,
    regional, and global levels; a more specific treatment of embodiment
    in contexts of privilege and power; and a stronger emphasis on the
    dynamics of hegemonic masculinity, recognizing internal
    contradictions and the possibilities of movement toward gender
    democracy."

- abstract: \"The teenager has often appeared in culture as an anxious
    figure, the repository for American dreams and worst nightmares, at
    once on the brink of success and imminent failure. Spotlighting the
    \"troubled teen\" as a site of pop cultural, medical, and
    governmental intervention, Chronic Youth traces the teenager as a
    figure through which broad threats to the normative order have been
    negotiated and contained. Examining television, popular novels,
    science journalism, new media, and public policy, Julie Passanante
    Elman shows how the teenager became a cultural touchstone for
    shifting notions of able-bodiedness, heteronormativity, and
    neoliberalism in the late twentieth century. By the late 1970s,
    media industries as well as policymakers began developing new
    problem-driven 'edutainment' prominently featuring narratives of
    disability--from the immunocompromised The Boy in the Plastic Bubble
    to ABC's After School Specials and teen sick-lit. Although this
    conjoining of disability and adolescence began as a storytelling
    convention, disability became much more than a metaphor as the
    process of medicalizing adolescence intensified by the 1990s, with
    parenting books containing neuro-scientific warnings about the
    incomplete and volatile \"teen brain.\" Undertaking a cultural
    history of youth that combines disability, queer, feminist, and
    comparative media studies, Elman offers a provocative new account of
    how American cultural producers, policymakers, and medical
    professionals have mobilized discourses of disability to cast
    adolescence as a treatable \"condition.\" By tracing the teen's
    uneven passage from postwar rebel to 21st century patient, Chronic
    Youth shows how teenagers became a lynchpin for a culture of
    perpetual rehabilitation and neoliberal governmentality\"--

- abstract: The number of transgender folks in the United States lost to
    murder increases every year. These murders have recently gained more
    recognition, with the memorials moving from trans-run organizations
    and communities to mainstream LGBTQ groups. Using visual culture and
    discourse analysis of four transgender murder memorials, I argue
    there are problematic trends of centering a white and cisgender
    audience, and lack of acknowledging trans livability. Memorials like
    Transgender Day of Remembrance take place every year, and though the
    oldest memorial for trans death in the country and most well known,
    the event creates a spectacle of violence for cisgender consumption
    and erases the race of the victims for white comfort. The Human
    Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ organization in the U.S., creates
    a yearly report on transgender violence. The report centers
    cisgender readers, a trend that the organization echoes in its
    history and practices. Online media conglomerate Mic.com launched an
    interactive database and report to highlight the trans murder
    epidemic, and unpack it with an intersectional lens. The visual
    aspects of the report highlight trans livability and self
    representation, reminding the readers that trans folks are not just
    murder victims. Finally, Autostraddle's online reporting by trans
    woman of color Mey Rude always reminds readers of the
    disproportionate rate that Black trans femmes are murdered compared
    to their cisgender and white counterparts. Rude also includes
    actionable steps for readers to support trans women of color while
    they're still here, highlighting the promotion of trans livability
    alongside trans mourning.

- abstract: Gender is familiar part of daily life that it usually takes
    a deliberate disruption of our expectations of how women and men are
    supposed to act to pay attention to how it is produced. Gendered
    roles change---today fathers are taking care of little children,
    girls and boys are wearing unisex clothing and getting the same
    education, women and men are working at the same jobs. In early
    childhood, humans develop gendered personality structures and sexual
    orientations through their interactions with parents of the same and
    opposite gender. The pervasiveness of gender as a way of structuring
    social life demands that gender statuses be clearly differentiated.
    As a social institution, gender is a process of creating
    distinguishable social statuses for the assignment of rights and
    responsibilities. When gender is a major component of structured
    inequality, the devalued genders have less power, prestige, and
    economic rewards than the valued genders.

- abstract: Gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy, "top"
    (e.g., chest reconstruction surgery) and "bottom" (e.g.,
    vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, etc.) surgeries, and
    puberty blockers, is an efficacious treatment of gender dysphoria
    for transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals.
    However, many TGNC people encounter significant barriers in
    accessing gender-affirming care, which we detail via results from on
    online study. Participants included 256 TGNC individuals (78.9%
    White, ages 16--73, Mage=28.4). Among participants, 61.3% were
    receiving hormone therapy, 22.7% had undergone top surgery, and 5.5%
    had undergone bottom surgery. Open-ended responses (n=201) were
    thematically analyzed and common barriers included finances and
    insurance issues, a lack of service availability, and fears or
    worries. Participants reported various systemic issues and incidents
    of bias within medical and mental health fields, as well as a lack
    of medical provider awareness and education. Other themes were
    interpersonal barriers (e.g., fears of rejection); age and need of
    parental consent for minors; other medical issues; and a lack of
    information about how to acquire care. These findings can be
    utilized to educate professionals in medical and mental health
    fields about barriers their TGNC patients may encounter in receiving
    affirming care, and suggest a number of ways to improve access to
    these services.

- abstract: \"In the updated second edition of Whipping Girl, Julia
    Serano, a transsexual woman whose supremely intelligent writing
    reflects her diverse background as a lesbian transgender activist
    and professional biologist, shares her powerful experiences and
    observations -- both pre- and post-transition -- to reveal the ways
    in which fear, suspicion, and dismissiveness toward femininity shape
    our societal attitudes toward trans women, as well as gender and
    sexuality as a whole. Serano's well-honed arguments stem from her
    ability to bridge the gap between the often-disparate biological and
    social perspectives on gender. In this provocative manifesto, she
    exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is
    frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this \"feminine\" weakness
    exists only to attract and appease male desire. In addition to
    debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes
    the case that today's feminists and transgender activists must work
    to embrace and empower femininity -- in all of its wondrous
    forms.\"--provided by Amazon.com
