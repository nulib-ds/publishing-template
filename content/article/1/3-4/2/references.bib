	title = {{EXPLORING} {ABLEISM} {AND} {CISNORMATIVITY} {IN} {THE} {CONCEPTUALIZATION} {OF} {IDENTITY} {AND} {SEXUALITY} “{DISORDERS}”},
	abstract = {This article explores different conceptualizations of, and debates about, Body Integrity Identity Disorder and Gender Identity Disorder to first examine how these “identity disorders” have been both linked to and distinguished from, the “sexual disorders” of apotemnophilia (the desire to amputate healthy limbs) and autogynephilia (the desire to perceive oneself as a woman). We argue that distinctions between identity disorders and sexual disorders or paraphilias reflect a troubling hierarchy in medical, social and political discourses between “legitimate” desires to transition or modify bodies (those based in identity claims) and “illegitimate” desires (those based in sexual desire or sexuality). This article secondly and more broadly explores how this hierarchy between “identity troubles” and paraphilias is rooted in a sex-negative, ableist, and cisnormative society, that makes it extremely difficult for activists, individuals, medical professionals, ethicists and anyone else, to conceptualize or understand the desires that some people express around transforming their bodies—whether the transformation relates to sex, gender or ability. We argue that instead of seeking to “explain” these desires in ways that further pathologize the people articulating them, we need to challenge the ableism and cisnormativity that require explanations for some bodies, subjectivities and desires while leaving dominant normative bodies and subjectivities intact. We thus end the article by exploring possibilities for forging connections between trans studies and critical disability studies that would open up options for listening and responding to the claims of transabled people.},

	abstract = {Drawing on an integrated theoretical lens of vocabularies of motive, gender interactionism, and queer theory, the authors explore how eighteen lesbian mothers and twenty-two gay fathers negotiate the cultural narratives of heteronormativity and gender essentialism as they imagine and participate in constructing their children's gender. Findings highlight the extent to which participants' parenting fantasies and realities occur within a context of heightened gender accountability that they manage for their children. The authors show how the practice of securing gender role models for their children is one way that non-heterosexual parents manage this accountability. Next, the authors introduce “queer ruptures” in participants' narratives and detail the subtle ways that they destabilize the existing heteronormative gender order. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for empirical and theoretical development.},

Perhaps your daughter recently asked you not to use gendered pronouns when referring to 'her' anymore, preferring that you use "they"; you're left wondering if this is just a phase, or if there's something more that you need to understand about your child.

This comprehensive guidebook helps to bridge that divide by exploring the unique challenges that thousands of families face every day raising a teenager who may be transgender, non-binary, gender-fluid or otherwise gender-expansive. Combining years of experience working in the field with extensive research and personal interviews, the authors cover pressing concerns relating to physical and emotional development, social and school pressures, medical considerations, and family communications. Learn how parents can more deeply understand their children, and raise their non-binary or transgender adolescent with love and compassion. -- Provided by publisher This book explores the unique challenges that thousands of families face every day raising a teenager who may be transgender, gender-variant or gender-fluid.

The author’s analyses indicate that parents welcome what they perceive as gender nonconformity among their young daughters, while their responses in relation to sons are more complex. Many parents across racial and class backgrounds accept or encourage some tendencies they consider atypical for boys. But this acceptance is balanced by efforts to approximate hegemonic ideals of masculinity. The author considers these patterns in the context of gender as an interactional accomplishment, demonstrating that parents are often consciously aware of their own role in accomplishing gender with and for their sons. Heterosexual fathers are especially likely to be motivated in that accomplishment work by their own personal endorsement of hegemonic masculinity, while heterosexual mothers and gay parents are more likely to be motivated by accountability to others in relation to those ideals.},

	abstract = {Conflict with the family about sexual orientation and gender diversity is a key risk factor associated with poor mental health in youth populations. Findings presented here derive from a UK study that employed an interdisciplinary critical mental health approach that de-pathologised emotional distress and conceptualised families as social and affective units that are created through everyday practices. Our aim was to explore how family relationships foster, maintain or harm the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ+ youth. Data were generated through exploratory visual, creative and digital qualitative methods in two phases. Phase 1 involved digital/paper emotion maps and interviews with LGBTQ+ youth aged 16 to 25 (n = 12) and family member/mentor interviews (n = 7). Phase 2 employed diary methods and follow-up interviews (n = 9). The data analytic strategy involved three stages: individual case analysis, cross-sectional thematic analysis and meta-interpretation. We found that family relationships impacted queer youth mental health in complex ways that were related to the establishment of their autonomous queer selves, the desire to remain belonging to their family and the need to maintain a secure environment. The emotion work involved in navigating identity, belonging and security was made difficult because of family heteronormativity, youth autonomy and family expectations, and had a stark impact on queer youth mental health and well-being. Improving the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth requires a much deeper understanding of the emotionality of family relationships and the difficulties negotiating these as a young person.},

This commentary article reflects on recent shifts in language, shifts in identity options, and shifts in the focus of intervention with gender non-conforming children.

            In accounting for their experiences of having a transgender child, cisgender parents often make recourse to a trope of loss to account for their journeys. A focus on loss is also evident in guides for parents and academic writing. In this article, the authors seek to produce an alternative account of loss, one that shifts the focus away from transgender children themselves and onto the broader context in which parents and their transgender children live, with a particular focus on schools. Specifically, the authors consider how cisgenderism produces a loss of certitude for parents, in that parents lose the invisible privileges that accrue to those who occupy an unmarked place within the cisgender norm. To do this, the authors draw on survey data from sixty Australian cisgender parents of transgender children, exploring specifically how they spoke about experiences with schools, both negative and positive.},

	abstract = {The concept of hegemonic masculinity has influenced gender studies across many academic fields but has also attracted serious criticism. The authors trace the origin of the concept in a convergence of ideas in the early 1980s and map the ways it was applied when research on men and masculinities expanded. Evaluating the principal criticisms, the authors defend the underlying concept of masculinity, which in most research use is neither reified nor essentialist. However, the criticism of trait models of gender and rigid typologies is sound. The treatment of the subject in research on hegemonic masculinity can be improved with the aid of recent psychological models, although limits to discursive flexibility must be recognized. The concept of hegemonic masculinity does not equate to a model of social reproduction; we need to recognize social struggles in which subordinated masculinities influence dominant forms. Finally, the authors review what has been confirmed from early formulations (the idea of multiple masculinities, the concept of hegemony, and the emphasis on change) and what needs to be discarded (onedimensional treatment of hierarchy and trait conceptions of gender). The authors suggest reformulation of the concept in four areas: a more complex model of gender hierarchy, emphasizing the agency of women; explicit recognition of the geography of masculinities, emphasizing the interplay among local, regional, and global levels; a more specific treatment of embodiment in contexts of privilege and power; and a stronger emphasis on the dynamics of hegemonic masculinity, recognizing internal contradictions and the possibilities of movement toward gender democracy.},

Spotlighting the "troubled teen" as a site of pop cultural, medical, and governmental intervention, Chronic Youth traces the teenager as a figure through which broad threats to the normative order have been negotiated and contained. Examining television, popular novels, science journalism, new media, and public policy, Julie Passanante Elman shows how the teenager became a cultural touchstone for shifting notions of able-bodiedness, heteronormativity, and neoliberalism in the late twentieth century. By the late 1970s, media industries as well as policymakers began developing new problem-driven 'edutainment' prominently featuring narratives of disability--from the immunocompromised The Boy in the Plastic Bubble to ABC's After School Specials and teen sick-lit. Although this conjoining of disability and adolescence began as a storytelling convention, disability became much more than a metaphor as the process of medicalizing adolescence intensified by the 1990s, with parenting books containing neuro-scientific warnings about the incomplete and volatile "teen brain." Undertaking a cultural history of youth that combines disability, queer, feminist, and comparative media studies, Elman offers a provocative new account of how American cultural producers, policymakers, and medical professionals have mobilized discourses of disability to cast adolescence as a treatable "condition." By tracing the teen's uneven passage from postwar rebel to 21st century patient, Chronic Youth shows how teenagers became a lynchpin for a culture of perpetual rehabilitation and neoliberal governmentality"--},

	abstract = {The number of transgender folks in the United States lost to murder increases every year. These murders have recently gained more recognition, with the memorials moving from trans-run organizations and communities to mainstream LGBTQ groups. Using visual culture and discourse analysis of four transgender murder memorials, I argue there are problematic trends of centering a white and cisgender audience, and lack of acknowledging trans livability. Memorials like Transgender Day of Remembrance take place every year, and though the oldest memorial for trans death in the country and most well known, the event creates a spectacle of violence for cisgender consumption and erases the race of the victims for white comfort. The Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ organization in the U.S., creates a yearly report on transgender violence. The report centers cisgender readers, a trend that the organization echoes in its history and practices. Online media conglomerate Mic.com launched an interactive database and report to highlight the trans murder epidemic, and unpack it with an intersectional lens. The visual aspects of the report highlight trans livability and self representation, reminding the readers that trans folks are not just murder victims. Finally, Autostraddle’s online reporting by trans woman of color Mey Rude always reminds readers of the disproportionate rate that Black trans femmes are murdered compared to their cisgender and white counterparts. Rude also includes actionable steps for readers to support trans women of color while they’re still here, highlighting the promotion of trans livability alongside trans mourning.},

	abstract = {Gender is familiar part of daily life that it usually takes a deliberate disruption of our expectations of how women and men are supposed to act to pay attention to how it is produced. Gendered roles change—today fathers are taking care of little children, girls and boys are wearing unisex clothing and getting the same education, women and men are working at the same jobs. In early childhood, humans develop gendered personality structures and sexual orientations through their interactions with parents of the same and opposite gender. The pervasiveness of gender as a way of structuring social life demands that gender statuses be clearly differentiated. As a social institution, gender is a process of creating distinguishable social statuses for the assignment of rights and responsibilities. When gender is a major component of structured inequality, the devalued genders have less power, prestige, and economic rewards than the valued genders.},

	abstract = {Gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy, “top” (e.g., chest reconstruction surgery) and “bottom” (e.g., vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, etc.) surgeries, and puberty blockers, is an efficacious treatment of gender dysphoria for transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals. However, many TGNC people encounter significant barriers in accessing gender-affirming care, which we detail via results from on online study. Participants included 256 TGNC individuals (78.9\% White, ages 16–73, Mage=28.4). Among participants, 61.3\% were receiving hormone therapy, 22.7\% had undergone top surgery, and 5.5\% had undergone bottom surgery. Open-ended responses (n=201) were thematically analyzed and common barriers included finances and insurance issues, a lack of service availability, and fears or worries. Participants reported various systemic issues and incidents of bias within medical and mental health fields, as well as a lack of medical provider awareness and education. Other themes were interpersonal barriers (e.g., fears of rejection); age and need of parental consent for minors; other medical issues; and a lack of information about how to acquire care. These findings can be utilized to educate professionals in medical and mental health fields about barriers their TGNC patients may encounter in receiving affirming care, and suggest a number of ways to improve access to these services.},

	abstract = {"In the updated second edition of Whipping Girl, Julia Serano, a transsexual woman whose supremely intelligent writing reflects her diverse background as a lesbian transgender activist and professional biologist, shares her powerful experiences and observations -- both pre- and post-transition -- to reveal the ways in which fear, suspicion, and dismissiveness toward femininity shape our societal attitudes toward trans women, as well as gender and sexuality as a whole. Serano's well-honed arguments stem from her ability to bridge the gap between the often-disparate biological and social perspectives on gender. In this provocative manifesto, she exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this "feminine" weakness exists only to attract and appease male desire. In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activists must work to embrace and empower femininity -- in all of its wondrous forms."--provided by Amazon.com},
