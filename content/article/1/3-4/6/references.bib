	title = {Living a {Feminist} {Life}},
	isbn = {978-0-8223-6319-4},
	abstract = {In Living a Feminist Life Sara Ahmed shows how feminist theory is generated from everyday life and the ordinary experiences of being a feminist at home and at work. Building on legacies of feminist of color scholarship in particular, Ahmed offers a poetic and personal meditation on how feminists become estranged from worlds they critique—often by naming and calling attention to problems—and how feminists learn about worlds from their efforts to transform them. Ahmed also provides her most sustained commentary on the figure of the feminist killjoy introduced in her earlier work while showing how feminists create inventive solutions—such as forming support systems—to survive the shattering experiences of facing the walls of racism and sexism. The killjoy survival kit and killjoy manifesto, with which the book concludes, supply practical tools for how to live a feminist life, thereby strengthening the ties between the inventive creation of feminist theory and living a life that sustains it.},

	abstract = {Growing attention to Black men’s development and outcomes has encouraged scholars to further consider how the intersection of race and gender influence these students’ collegiate experiences (McGuire, Berhanu, Davis, \& Harper, 2014; Pelzer, 2016). However, “it is one thing to study Black men’s gendered experiences (e.g., gendered racism) and it is another to study Black men as gendered persons” (McGuire et al., 2014, p. 257). Even less is known about the gendered and racialized realities of Black trans masculine students (Duran, 2018; Jourian, 2017). Through a secondary analysis of data utilizing quare theory (E. P. Johnson, 2005) and Blacktransfeminist thought (Green \& Bey, 2017), we unveil how Black trans masculine collegians negotiate engagement with Black masculinity through their voices and presence within Black and queer spaces and in quaring and transing of Black masculinity. Our findings, dichotomized by much to be undone and much to be done, point to the ongoing simultaneity of needing to undo harmful and essentialized notions of Black masculinity and creating new possibilities and ways of doing Black masculinity. This study advances inquiry into the students’ desire to disengage Black masculinity from the oppressive forces of cisheteropatriarchy and misogynoir (Bailey, 2013), complicating characterizations of Black collegians. We call for the theoretical and practical subversion of essentialist notions of manhood, masculinity, Blackness, and their junctures from a decidedly Black center through the intersectional analytics of quare theory and Blacktransfeminist thought.},

Drawing on black studies, studies of race, cultural geography, and black feminism as well as a mix of methods, citational practices, and theoretical frameworks, she positions black storytelling and stories as strategies of invention and collaboration. She analyzes a number of texts from intellectuals and artists ranging from Sylvia Wynter to the electronica band Drexciya to explore how narratives of imprecision and relationality interrupt knowledge systems that seek to observe, index, know, and discipline blackness. Throughout, McKittrick offers curiosity, wonder, citations, numbers, playlists, friendship, poetry, inquiry, song, grooves, and anticolonial chronologies as interdisciplinary codes that entwine with the academic form. Suggesting that black life and black livingness are, in themselves, rebellious methodologies, McKittrick imagines without totally disclosing the ways in which black intellectuals invent ways of living outside prevailing knowledge systems.},
