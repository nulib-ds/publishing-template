- abstract: In Living a Feminist Life Sara Ahmed shows how feminist
    theory is generated from everyday life and the ordinary experiences
    of being a feminist at home and at work. Building on legacies of
    feminist of color scholarship in particular, Ahmed offers a poetic
    and personal meditation on how feminists become estranged from
    worlds they critique---often by naming and calling attention to
    problems---and how feminists learn about worlds from their efforts
    to transform them. Ahmed also provides her most sustained commentary
    on the figure of the feminist killjoy introduced in her earlier work
    while showing how feminists create inventive solutions---such as
    forming support systems---to survive the shattering experiences of
    facing the walls of racism and sexism. The killjoy survival kit and
    killjoy manifesto, with which the book concludes, supply practical
    tools for how to live a feminist life, thereby strengthening the
    ties between the inventive creation of feminist theory and living a
    life that sustains it.

- abstract: Growing attention to Black men's development and outcomes
    has encouraged scholars to further consider how the intersection of
    race and gender influence these students' collegiate experiences
    (McGuire, Berhanu, Davis, & Harper, 2014; Pelzer, 2016). However,
    "it is one thing to study Black men's gendered experiences (e.g.,
    gendered racism) and it is another to study Black men as gendered
    persons" (McGuire et al., 2014, p. 257). Even less is known about
    the gendered and racialized realities of Black trans masculine
    students (Duran, 2018; Jourian, 2017). Through a secondary analysis
    of data utilizing quare theory (E. P. Johnson, 2005) and
    Blacktransfeminist thought (Green & Bey, 2017), we unveil how Black
    trans masculine collegians negotiate engagement with Black
    masculinity through their voices and presence within Black and queer
    spaces and in quaring and transing of Black masculinity. Our
    findings, dichotomized by much to be undone and much to be done,
    point to the ongoing simultaneity of needing to undo harmful and
    essentialized notions of Black masculinity and creating new
    possibilities and ways of doing Black masculinity. This study
    advances inquiry into the students' desire to disengage Black
    masculinity from the oppressive forces of cisheteropatriarchy and
    misogynoir (Bailey, 2013), complicating characterizations of Black
    collegians. We call for the theoretical and practical subversion of
    essentialist notions of manhood, masculinity, Blackness, and their
    junctures from a decidedly Black center through the intersectional
    analytics of quare theory and Blacktransfeminist thought.

- abstract: "This qualitative study explores the collegiate experiences
    of four Black gay male students who attend historically Black
    universities. The study utilizes a quare theory framework, an
    alternative framework to queer theory. Quare theory calls our
    attention to the intersection of race, gender, class, and sexual
    orientation. Data were collected through a 1:1 interview with each
    participant and photovoice. This study reveals how the students
    navigate their collegiate experiences, internalize homophobia, begin
    to embrace their own sexual orientation identity, and find support
    (or lack of support) for their sexual orientation identities.
    Recommendations for practice and directions for future research are
    offered."

- abstract: In Dear Science and Other Stories Katherine McKittrick
    presents a creative and rigorous study of black and anticolonial
    methodologies. Drawing on black studies, studies of race, cultural
    geography, and black feminism as well as a mix of methods,
    citational practices, and theoretical frameworks, she positions
    black storytelling and stories as strategies of invention and
    collaboration. She analyzes a number of texts from intellectuals and
    artists ranging from Sylvia Wynter to the electronica band Drexciya
    to explore how narratives of imprecision and relationality interrupt
    knowledge systems that seek to observe, index, know, and discipline
    blackness. Throughout, McKittrick offers curiosity, wonder,
    citations, numbers, playlists, friendship, poetry, inquiry, song,
    grooves, and anticolonial chronologies as interdisciplinary codes
    that entwine with the academic form. Suggesting that black life and
    black livingness are, in themselves, rebellious methodologies,
    McKittrick imagines without totally disclosing the ways in which
    black intellectuals invent ways of living outside prevailing
    knowledge systems.

- abstract: This qualitative study examined how 6 African American men
    at one historically Black college made meaning of their gay or
    bisexual identity, made decisions about to whom they disclosed this
    identity, and how their sexual identity experiences were mediated
    given the context of the campus environment. The findings suggest
    although this particular HBCU (historically Black college and
    university) provided the participants an overall supportive and
    uplifting environment, they experienced challenges with publicly
    expressing their sexual identities. Implications and recommendations
    for future research and practice are offered.

- abstract: In this article, the author provides an overview of existing
    literature addressing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT),
    and queer issues in higher education. She argues that although
    colleges and universities are the source of much critical and
    postmodern writing about LGBT and queer topics, scholarship on
    LGBT/queer people and organizations in higher education itself lacks
    theoretical depth. The author points to ways that existing research
    approaches and theoretical stances benefit higher education practice
    and suggests areas in which attention to methodological rigor and
    theoretical advancement is needed.
