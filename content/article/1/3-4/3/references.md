- abstract: What was really compelling was this idea that if I joined
    the gender critical movement, I could finally get over this pain
    I've been carrying. I could finally get over this trauma and feel
    better about myself. But like life, it didn't work like that.

- abstract: The question of judicial protection of trans people has come
    to the fore in recent years, culminating in Bill C-16 which added
    gender identity and gender expression to the federal
    anti-discrimination and hate crime laws. In this article, the author
    contests the notion that anti-discrimination and hate crime laws are
    effective in mitigating anti-trans harassment, discrimination, and
    violence. Suggesting that the model of anti-trans acts which
    underlies anti-discrimination and hate crime laws is erroneous, the
    author argues that the law's impact on trans well-being will be
    modest and that a careful analysis of anti-trans attitudes enables
    us to identify a number of more effective governmental avenues
    toward trans emancipation.

- abstract: The term rapid-onset gender dysphoria? (ROGD) was coined in
    2016 to describe an alleged epidemic of youth coming out as trans
    ?out of the blue? due to social contagion and mental illness. The
    term reflects a deliberate attempt to weaponise scientific-sounding
    language to dismiss mounting empirical evidence of the benefits of
    transition. This article offers an introduction to the theory of
    ROGD and its history, presents a detailed critique of the empirical
    and theoretical claims associated with the theory, and highlights
    structural concerns with the ROGD discourse. The article argues that
    claims associated with ROGD, including assertions of declining
    mental health and degrading familial relationships following coming
    out, are best explained by the leading ROGD study?s recruitment of
    parents from transantagonistic websites against a background of
    growing visibility and social acceptance of trans people. ROGD
    theory is best understood as an attempt to circumvent existing
    research demonstrating the importance of gender affirmation, relying
    on scientific-sounding language to achieve respectability.

- abstract: Primary care must ensure high quality lifelong care is
    offered to trans and gender minority patients who are known to have
    poor health and adverse healthcare experiences. This quality
    improvement project aimed to interrogate and audit the data of trans
    and gender minority patients in one primary care population in
    England. A new data collection instrument was created examining
    pathways of care, assessments and interventions undertaken,
    monitoring, and complications. General practitioners identified a
    sample from the patient population and then performed an audit to
    examine against an established standard of care. No appropriate
    primary care audit standard was found. There was inconsistency
    between multiple UK gender identity clinics' (GIC) individual
    recommended schedules of care and between specialty guidelines.
    Using an international, secondary care, evidence-informed guideline,
    it appeared that up to two-thirds of patients did not receive all
    recommended monitoring standards, largely due to inconsistencies
    between GIC and international guidance. It is imperative that an
    evidence-based primary care guideline is devised alongside
    measurable standards. Given the findings of long waits, high rates
    of medical complexity, and some undesired treatment outcomes
    (including a fifth of patients stopping hormones of whom more than
    half cited regret or detransition experiences), this small but
    population-based quality improvement approach should be replicated
    and expanded upon at scale.

    variant young people referred by the National Health Service (NHS)
    Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) to, and discharged from
    the two English paediatric endocrine liaison clinics is not known.
    Methods 1151 young people referred after full assessment by the
    GIDS; 827 to University College London Hospital since 2008; 324 to
    Leeds Children's Hospital since 2013. Discharge categorisation was
    by agreed criteria. Eleven emigrated and 51 self-discharged. 1089
    had known outcomes. Results 999/1089 (91.7%) continued identifying
    as gender variant. 867/999 (86.8%) were discharged to adult gender
    identity clinics (GICs). 166/867 (19.1%) of these were \\<16 years
    and 701/867 (80.9%) ≥16 years at initial endocrine referral. No sex
    differences were seen. 38/999 (3.8%) opted for non-NHS
    services.90/1089 ceased identifying as gender variant. In 32/1089
    (2.9%), this was subsequent to their first clinic
    appointment.58/1089 (5.3%) stopped treatment either with the
    gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) or gender-affirming
    hormones (GAH) and reverted to their birth gender: \\<16 years
    (20/217; 9.2%); ≥16 years (38/872; 4.4%).Subdividing further, 16/217
    (7.4%) \\<16 years ceased GnRHa and 4/217 (1.8%) after GAH. Of those
    ≥16 years, 33/872 (3.8%) ceased GnRHa and 5/872 (0.6%) GAH.
    Conclusions At discharge, 91.7% continued as transgender or gender
    variant, 86.8% sought ongoing care through NHS GICs. 2.9% ceased
    identifying as transgender after an initial consultation prior to
    any endocrine intervention and 5.3% stopped treatment either with
    GnRHa or GAH, a higher proportion in the \\<16 year compared with the

- abstract: Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork with transgender
    individuals and communities, this article explores transgender
    audiences' interactions with what I call "breakout texts," media
    that portray "first of its kind" representation. I analyze the films
    Boys Don't Cry (1999) and TransAmerica (2005) as transgender
    breakout texts, or media that break into the cultural mainstream,
    break with historical representational paradigms, and break into the
    everyday life of viewers. Focusing mainly on this last break, I
    examine how transgender audiences discern breakout texts through a
    paradigm of mediatized "linked fate" (Dawson, 1994); how audiences
    move from "cultural readers" (Bobo, 1988) to cultural interpreters
    as a result of breakout texts' cultural popularity; and how
    audiences engage in "queer identity work" (Gray, 2009) with breakout
    texts.

- abstract: Anselm is perhaps best known for creating the grounded
    theory method with Barney G. Glaser. The Discovery of Grounded
    Theory was a cutting-edge book that fueled the qualitative
    revolution. I agree -- strongly -- with Norm Denzin and Yvonna
    Lincoln (1994, p. ix) that a qualitative revolution has taken place
    in the United States. The Discovery book arrived on the sociological
    scene at just the right time. Quantitative research had become
    systematic and quantitative researchers saw their work as
    "scientific." The worship of a narrow conception of science
    abounded. By the time Anselm studied at Chicago, qualitative
    scholars had moved from life histories to case studies and
    established a rich ethnographic tradition that shaped Chicago School
    sociology in the 1940s. Yet, by the time Barney and Anselm wrote The
    Discovery of Grounded Theory in 1967, quantification was becoming
    entrenched as "the" sociological method. The ethnographic tradition
    was losing ground.

- abstract: Gender detransition is an emerging yet poorly understood
    phenomenon in our society. In the absence of research, clinicians
    and researchers have applied the concept of detransition
    differently, leading to inconsistencies in its use. The article
    suggests a typology of gender detransition based on the cessation or
    the continuation of a transgender identity to address this issue.
    Implications of this typology for healthcare providers are
    discussed, emphasizing the increasing necessity of developing
    clinical guidelines for detransitioners. Finally, the article
    reflects on the possibilities of preventing detransition, which
    underlines the challenges that clinicians face when treating
    individuals with gender dysphoria.

- abstract: "The purpose was to determine the association of lifestyle
    (i.e., Mediterranean diet \\[MD\\] adherence, physical activity
    \\[PA\\], screen time \\[ST\\]) and fitness with abdominal obesity (AO)
    and excess weight in the Chilean and Colombian schoolchildren. This
    cross-sectional study included 969 schoolchildren, girls (n = 441,
    5.24 ± 0.80 years old) and boys (n = 528, 5.10 ± 0.78 years old)
    from Chile (n = 611) and Colombia (n = 358). The body mass index
    (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), MD
    adherence, PA, ST and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) were
    evaluated. The association of AO and anthropometric variables with
    lifestyle was estimated through multiple linear regression. To
    determine the association between AO and lifestyle, a logistic
    regression and the inclusion of odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
    confidence intervals (CIs) were used. Worse CRF in Chilean children
    were positively correlated with WC. Excess weight in Chilean and
    Colombian children was positively associated with an unhealthy
    lifestyle. In Chilean children unhealthy lifestyle was also
    associated with AO based on WC ≥ 85th percentile and AO based on
    WtHR ≥ 85th percentile. In Chilean children, excess weight (BMI ≥
    85th percentile) was positively associated with poor MD adherence.
    AO and excess weight were associated with an unhealthy lifestyle in
    Latin-American schoolchildren. Interventions to reduce the
    prevalence of AO should include promoting healthier lifestyle
    choices (i.e., increasing PA after school, reducing ST and improving
    CRF). El propósito fue determinar la asociación del estilo de vida
    (es decir, adherencia a la dieta mediterránea \\[DM\\], actividad
    física \\[AF\\], tiempo frente a la pantalla \\[TP\\]) y aptitud física
    con obesidad abdominal (OA) y exceso de peso en escolares chilenos y
    colombianos. Este estudio transversal incluyó a 969 escolares, niñas
    (n = 441; 5,24 ± 0,80 años) y niños (n = 528; 5,10 ± 0,78 años) de
    Chile (n = 611) y Colombia (n = 358). Se evaluaron el índice de masa
    corporal (IMC), la circunferencia de la cintura (CC), la relación
    cintura-altura (RCE), la adherencia a la DM, la AF, la TP y la
    aptitud cardiorrespiratoria (CRF). La asociación de OA y variables
    antropométricas con el estilo de vida se estimó mediante regresión
    lineal múltiple. Para determinar la asociación entre OA y estilo de
    vida se utilizó una regresión logística y la inclusión de odds
    ratios (OR) con intervalos de confianza (IC) del 95%. Menor CRF en
    los niños chilenos se correlacionó positivamente con la CC. El
    exceso de peso en preescolares chilenos y colombianos se asoció
    positivamente con un mal estilo de vida (3-5 años). Además, en los
    niños chilenos de 3 a 5 años un mal estilo de vida se asoció con AO
    basado en CC ≥ percentil 85 y OA basado en RCE ≥ percentil 85. En
    los niños chilenos, el exceso de peso (IMC ≥ percentil 85) se asoció
    positivamente con una mala adherencia a la DM. La OA y el exceso de
    peso se asociaron con un mal estilo de vida en preescolares
    latinoamericanos. Las intervenciones para reducir la prevalencia de
    OA deben incluir la promoción de un estilo de vida saludable (es
    decir, aumentar la AF después de la escuela, reducir el TP y mejorar
    la CRF). La cirugía bariátrica tiene como objetivo la reducción del
    peso y la resolución de las comorbilidades asociadas a la obesidad.
    Los estudios que valoran la evolución del perfil lipídico comparando
    gastrectomía vertical (GV) y bypass gástrico (BP) a medio-largo
    plazo son escasos. Este estudio tiene como objetivo evaluar y
    comparar la variación del perfil lipídico con cada técnica a 60
    meses. Estudio observacional de cohortes analíticas retrospectivo
    que recogió 100 pacientes distribuidos en 2 grupos, 50 intervenidos
    mediante BP y 50 mediante GV. Se determinó el colesterol total (CT),
    las lipoproteínas de baja densidad (LDL), las lipoproteínas de alta
    densidad (HDL) y los triglicéridos (TG) preoperatoriamente a 1, 6,
    12, 24, 36, 48 y 60 meses. También se evaluó la pérdida ponderal y
    la resolución de dislipemias según la técnica. De 100 pacientes, 95
    completaron el seguimiento. A los 60 meses, el CT y las LDL se
    redujeron significativamente en el grupo BP (167,42 ± 31,22 y 88,06
    ± 31,37 mg/dl, respectivamente), mientras que el grupo GV no obtuvo
    diferencias. Ambas técnicas mostraron un aumento del HDL (BP: 62,69
    ± 16,3 mg/dl versus GV: 60,64 ± 18,73 mg/dl), sin hallar diferencias
    entre los 2 procedimientos. Los TG disminuyeron en ambos grupos (BP:
    86,06 ± 56,57 mg/dl versus GV: 111,09 ± 53,08 mg/dl), siendo
    superiores los resultados del bypass (p \\< 0,05). El porcentaje de
    sobrepeso perdido (PSP) fue mayor en el grupo BP: 75,65 ± 22,98
    mg/dl versus grupo GV: 57,83 ± 27,95 mg/dl. El BP obtuvo mejores
    resultados en cuanto a reducción del peso y la resolución de
    hipercolesterolemia comparado con la gastrectomía vertical a
    medio-largo plazo. Mientras que el BP mejoró todos los parámetros
    del perfil lipídico, la gastrectomía vertical solo lo hizo con las
    HDL y los triglicéridos. Bariatric surgery aims to reduce weight and
    resolve the comorbidities associated with obesity. Few studies have
    assessed mid/long-term changes in lipid profile with sleeve
    gastrectomy versus gastric bypass. This study was conducted to
    assess and compare changes in lipid profile with each procedure
    after 60 months. This was an observational, retrospective study of
    analytical cohorts enrolling 100 patients distributed into two
    groups: 50 had undergone gastric bypass (GBP) surgery and 50 sleeve
    gastrectomy (SG) surgery. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density
    lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride
    (TG) levels were measured before surgery and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48
    and 60 months. Weight loss and the resolution of dyslipidemia with
    each of the procedures were also assessed. Ninety-five of the 100
    patients completed follow-up. At 60 months, TC and LDL levels had
    significantly decreased in the GBP group (167.42 ± 31.22 mg/dl and
    88.06 ± 31.37 mg/dl, respectively), while there were no differences
    in the SG group. Increased HDL levels were seen with both procedures
    (GBP: 62.69 ± 16.3 mg/dl vs. SG: 60.64 ± 18.73 mg/dl), with no
    difference between the procedures. TG levels decreased in both
    groups (GBP: 86.06 ± 56.57 mg/dl vs. SG: 111.09 ± 53.08 mg/dl), but
    values were higher in the GBP group (p\\<0.05). The percentage of
    overweight lost (PSP) was higher in the GBP group: 75.65 ± 22.98
    mg/dl vs. the GV group: 57.83 ± 27.95 mg/dl. Gastric bypass achieved
    better mid/long-term results in terms of weight reduction and the
    resolution of hypercholesterolemia as compared to sleeve
    gastrectomy. While gastric bypass improved all lipid profile
    parameters, sleeve gastrectomy only improved HDL and triglyceride
    levels. A wide variation in height gain rate is observed in children
    small for gestational age (SGA) treated with growth hormone (GH).
    The aim of this study was to evaluate prepubertal and pubertal
    growth, height gain attained at adult age and to assess potential
    predictive factors in catch-up growth. Changes in metabolic profile
    were also analyzed. Seventy-eight children born SGA were treated
    with a GH median dose of 33.0 ± 2.8 mcg/kg/day at a mean age of 7.3
    ± 2.0 (boys) and 6.0 ± 1.8 (girls). Mean height (SDS) at GH onset
    was −3.31 ± 0.7 for boys and −3.48 ± 0.7 for girls. According to age
    at pubertal growth spurt onset patients were classified in their
    pubertal maturity group. Adult height attained expressed in SDS was
    −1.75 ± 0.7 for boys and −1.69 ± 1.0 for girls, both below the range
    of their mid-parental height. The greatest height gain occurred
    during the prepubertal period. Patients with greater height gain
    were lighter (p \\< 0.001), shorter (p = 0.005), and younger (p =
    0.02) at the start of GH, and also showed a greater increase in
    growth velocity during the first year on GH (p \\< 0.001). SGA
    children started puberty at the same age and with the same
    distribution into pubertal maturity group as the reference
    population. No relevant GH-related adverse events were reported,
    including in the insulin resistance parameters evaluated.
    Differences were found in fasting plasma glucose values, but were
    without clinical relevance. IGF-I plasma values remained within the
    safety range. GH therapy is safe and beneficial for SGA children.
    The response to GH therapy is widely heterogeneous, suggesting that
    GH should be started at a young age and the GH dose prescribed
    should be individualized. SGA children started puberty at the same
    age as the reference population. The only factor that predicts
    greater adult height is growth velocity during the first year of
    therapy. Existe una gran variabilidad en la ganancia de talla en los
    pacientes pequeños para edad gestacional (PEG) tratados con hormona
    de crecimiento (GH). El objetivo de nuestro trabajo fue evaluar el
    crecimiento prepuberal y puberal, la ganancia de talla alcanzada a
    la edad adulta, analizar los factores predictivos de mejor ganancia
    estatural y evaluar los cambios en el perfil metabólico. Setenta y
    ocho niños PEG iniciaron tratamiento con GH a una edad media de 7,3
    ± 2,0 (niños) y de 6,0 ± 1,8 (niñas), con una talla media (DE) de
    --3,31 ± 0,7 (niños) y de --3,48 ± 0,7 (niñas). Dosis de GH: 33,0 ±
    2,8 mcg/kg/día. De acuerdo con la edad al inicio del brote puberal
    de crecimiento, los pacientes se clasificaron de acuerdo a su grupo
    madurador. La talla alcanzada a la edad adulta fue de --1,75 ± 0,7
    (niños) y de --1,69 ± 1,0 (niñas), y estaba situada por debajo de su
    talla media parental. Los pacientes que mostraron una mayor ganancia
    de talla fueron los de menor peso (p \\< 0,001), menor talla (p =
    0,005) y menor edad (p = 0,02) al inicio de la GH, y también los que
    mostraron un mayor incremento de la velocidad de crecimiento durante
    el primer año de tratamiento con GH (p \\< 0,001). Los pacientes PEG
    iniciaron la pubertad a la misma edad y con una distribución en los
    grupos maduradores similar a la población de referencia. No se
    observaron eventos adversos relacionados con la GH ni en los índices
    de resistencia a la insulina. Tan solo se hallaron diferencias
    significativas sin relevancia clínica en los valores de glucosa
    plasmática en ayunas. Los valores plasmáticos de IGF-I se
    mantuvieron dentro del rango de seguridad. El tratamiento con GH es
    seguro y beneficioso para los niños PEG. La mayor ganancia de talla
    ocurre durante el período prepuberal y es heterogénea, lo que
    sugiere que la GH debe iniciarse a una edad temprana y que es
    preciso individualizar su dosis. La pubertad se inicia a una edad
    similar a la población general. El único factor que predice una
    mayor ganancia de talla adulta es la velocidad de crecimiento
    durante el primer año de tratamiento. The renin--angiotensin system
    (RAS) is one of the most complex hormonal regulatory systems,
    involving several organs that interact to regulate multiple body
    functions. The study of this system initially focused on
    investigating its role in the regulation of both cardiovascular
    function and related pathologies. From this approach,
    pharmacological strategies were developed for the treatment of
    cardiovascular diseases. However, new findings in recent decades
    have suggested that the RAS is much more complex and comprises two
    subsystems, the classic RAS and an alternative RAS, with
    antagonistic effects that are usually in equilibrium. The classic
    system is involved in pathologies where inflammatory, hypertrophic
    and fibrotic phenomena are common and is related to the development
    of chronic diseases that affect various body systems. This
    understanding has been reinforced by the evidence that local
    renin--angiotensin systems exist in many tissue types and by the
    role of the RAS in the spread and severity of COVID-19 infection,
    where it was discovered that viral entry into cells of the
    respiratory system is accomplished through binding to
    angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is present in the alveolar
    epithelium and is overexpressed in patients with chronic
    cardiometabolic diseases. In this narrative review, preclinical and
    clinical aspects of the RAS are presented and topics for future
    research are discussed some aspects are raised that should be
    clarified in the future and that call for further investigation of
    this system. El sistema renina angiotensina es uno de los sistemas
    de regulación hormonal más complejos, pues participan varios órganos
    qué interactúan entre sí para regular múltiples funciones
    corporales. En un inicio el estudio de este sistema se enfocó en
    investigar su papel en la regulación, tanto de la función
    cardiovascular como de las enfermedades relacionadas. A partir de
    este enfoque se desarrollaron estrategias farmacológicas para el
    tratamiento de enfermedades cardiovasculares. Sin embargo, en las
    últimas décadas y con nuevos hallazgos se ha planteado que el
    sistema renina angiotensina es un sistema mucho más complejo
    constituido por 2 subsistemas, uno clásico y otro alternativo que
    tienen efectos antagónicos, normalmente en equilibrio. El predominio
    del sistema clásico está involucrado en enfermedades donde los
    fenómenos inflamatorios, hipertróficos y fibróticos son comunes y se
    relacionan con el desarrollo de enfermedades crónicas que afectan
    diversos sistemas. Esto se ha reforzado por la evidencia de que
    existen sistemas renina angiotensina locales en muchos tejidos, y
    por el papel del sistema renina angiotensina en la propagación y
    severidad de la infección por la COVID-19, en donde se descubrió que
    el ingreso del virus en el sistema respiratorio se realiza a través
    de la enzima convertidora de angiotensina 2, presente en el epitelio
    alveolar y que se sobreexpresa en pacientes con enfermedades
    cardiometabólicas crónicas. En la presente revisión narrativa se
    presentan aspectos preclínicos y clínicos de ese sistema y se
    plantean algunos aspectos que se deben aclarar en el futuro y que
    demandarán más investigación de este sistema."

- abstract: BackgroundUK adult gender identity clinics (GICs) are
    implementing a new streamlined service model. However, there is
    minimal evidence from these services underpinning this. It is also
    unknown how many service users subsequently 'detransition'.AimsTo
    describe service users' access to care and patterns of service use,
    specifically, interventions accessed, reasons for discharge and
    re-referrals; to identify factors associated with access; and to
    quantify 'detransitioning'.MethodA retrospective case-note review
    was performed as a service evaluation for 175 service users
    consecutively discharged by a tertiary National Health Service adult
    GIC between 1 September 2017 and 31 August 2018. Descriptive
    statistics were used for rates of accessing interventions sought,
    reasons for discharge, re-referral and frequency of detransitioning.
    Using multivariate analysis, we sought associations between several
    variables and 'accessing care' or 'other outcome'.ResultsThe
    treatment pathway was completed by 56.1%. All interventions
    initially sought were accessed by 58%; 94% accessed hormones but
    only 47.7% accessed gender reassignment surgery; 21.7% disengaged;
    and 19.4% were re-referred. Multivariate analysis identified
    coexisting neurodevelopmental disorders (odds ratio \[OR\] = 5.7,
    95% CI = 1.7--19), previous adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) per
    reported ACE (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1--1.9), substance misuse during
    treatment (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.1--17.6) and mental health concerns
    during treatment (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.1--4.4) as independently
    associated with accessing care. Twelve people (6.9%) met our case
    definition of detransitioning.ConclusionsService users may have
    unmet needs. Neurodevelopmental disorders or ACEs suggest complexity
    requiring consideration during the assessment process. Managing
    mental ill health and substance misuse during treatment needs
    optimising. Detransitioning might be more frequent than previously
    reported.

- abstract: Approximately 40 years ago, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss
    and their joint research approach, the constant comparative method
    of grounded theory, were at the forefront of what can be called a
    qualitative revolution. The publication of their book, The discovery
    of grounded theory (1967), was a breakthrough because of the
    systematic procedures for qualitative research that were presented.
    Prior to this publication, qualitative research methodology was
    traditionally most often taught orally. Through their book, Glaser
    and Strauss defended the method of qualitative research and
    countered the prevailing opinion that quantitative research provided
    the one and only approach to scientific inquiry. They argued that
    qualitative research is a field of inquiry in its own right, not
    merely to be used for pre-studies to "real" statistically based
    studies. The grounded theory method fits in with life world
    research, because the emphasis is on individuals as unique living
    wholes and the researcher focuses on the world as it is experienced
    by the individual. The researcher does not formulate any hypothesis
    in advance and tries to approach the research area with as few
    preconceptions as possible. Preconceptions, taken-for-granted
    assumptions, and interpretations must be handled by reflexive
    strategies in line with what Dahlberg has labelled "bridling".
    Grounded theory offers the researcher a set of guidelines for
    building conceptual frameworks that specify the relationships among
    categories. The guidelines should be used as flexible tools rather
    than being seen as rigid rules. Grounded theory is a broad method
    with distinct procedures that work in practice and that are suitable
    to pragmatic researchers. The "core category" in grounded theory is,
    as I see it, the constant comparative method. The grounded theory
    method has been modified by the era within which it exists and by
    new ideas encountered in the world of inquiry (Annells, ). Varying
    views of what reality is and how it can be known affect the modes of
    the grounded theory method.

- abstract: Detransition is tied to three related but distinct concepts
    ? the act of detransitioning, the ?detransitioner? identity, and the
    negative transition experience ? which I refer to collectively using
    the umbrella term ?detrans?. Detrans research is inevitably
    political and value-laden, but different methodologies and research
    questions lend themselves to divergent goals. Drawing on work in the
    feminist philosophy of science and transfeminist scholarship, I draw
    a conceptual distinction between research aligned with the goals of
    ?preventing detrans? vs. ?supporting detrans?. Existing research has
    constructed detransition as a negative clinical outcome to be
    prevented because it has been focused on the causes of detrans and
    the detrans rate. Research associated with the goal of supporting
    detrans is defined by its focus on the experience and process of
    detrans itself. Research on preventing detrans constructs detrans as
    a divisive issue of zero-sum clinical risk, and it is not oriented
    toward helping people who detransition or who have a negative
    transition experience. Research on supporting detrans, in contrast,
    constructs detrans as an issue of inclusion and can be used to
    improve the medical and mental health care that detrans people
    receive. I argue that there is an urgent need for qualitative
    sociological research involving detrans people. I conclude with some
    broad guidelines for researchers studying detrans.

- abstract: A series of three studies were conducted to develop and
    validate a scale to measure violence, harassment, and discrimination
    toward cross-dressers, transgenderists, and transsexuals. In Study
    1, we developed the Genderism and Transphobia Scale (GTS). In Study
    2, we established the GTS's ability to predict parents' reactions to
    either a gender conforming or a gender non-conforming boy or girl.
    Correlations between the GTS and scales that assess homophobia and
    gender role ideologies suggest convergent validity. In Study 3, we
    conducted a factor analysis of the scale, found further evidence of
    the scale's discriminant and convergent validity, and tested the
    scale's ability to predict previous contact with gender
    non-conformists. Taken as a whole, the results of these studies
    demonstrate the basic psychometric properties of a new and useful
    scale to measure antipathy toward people who cross genders and
    sexes.

- abstract: The medicalization of gender variance is a key force in
    transgender people's experiences of embodiment, identity, and
    community. While most directly dictating experiences of diagnosis
    and medical classification, it is important to acknowledge that the
    effects of medicalization are widespread across social contexts and
    institutions. I explore the medical model of transgender identity,
    with special attention to its current diagnostic classification, in
    order to highlight how transgender people's interactional
    experiences of gender are shaped by medical authority. I review
    literature that highlights the operation of the medical model as a
    normative accountability structure in its influence across multiple
    institutions of social life including health and healthcare,
    transgender community groups, and legal classification.

- abstract: While prior research has called attention to how medically
    based, normative understandings of sex and gender place undue
    restrictions on transgender people's autonomy, there has yet to be
    an attempt to consolidate this research into a recognizable concept
    that is situated within existing theoretical frameworks. This
    article uses documentary films focused on transgender men as an
    empirical example to develop the concept of transnormativity.
    Transnormativity describes the specific framework to which
    transgender people's presentations and experiences of gender are
    held accountable. Drawing on research specific to transgender
    community groups, medicalization, and legal transition, I argue that
    transnormativity structures transgender experience, identification,
    and narratives into a hierarchy of legitimacy that is dependent upon
    medical standards. This ideology, as I show via a content analysis
    of documentary films, circulates in media depictions of transgender
    people in ways that eclipse alternative explanations of gender
    non-conformity. While medical transition is a central component of
    many transgender people's gender trajectory, I argue in this article
    that the privileging of the medical model over others creates a
    marginalizing effect for gender-non-conforming people who cannot or
    do not wish to medically transition.

    discontinuing medications, having surgery to reverse the effects of
    transition, or both. Recruitment information with a link to an
    anonymous survey was shared on social media, professional listservs,
    and via snowball sampling. Sixty-nine percent of the 100
    participants were natal female and 31.0% were natal male. Reasons
    for detransitioning were varied and included: experiencing
    discrimination (23.0%); becoming more comfortable identifying as
    their natal sex (60.0%); having concerns about potential medical
    complications from transitioning (49.0%); and coming to the view
    that their gender dysphoria was caused by something specific such as
    trauma, abuse, or a mental health condition (38.0%). Homophobia or
    difficulty accepting themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual was
    expressed by 23.0% as a reason for transition and subsequent
    detransition. The majority (55.0%) felt that they did not receive an
    adequate evaluation from a doctor or mental health professional
    before starting transition and only 24.0% of respondents informed
    their clinicians that they had detransitioned. There are many
    different reasons and experiences leading to detransition. More
    research is needed to understand this population, determine the
    prevalence of detransition as an outcome of transition, meet the
    medical and psychological needs of this population, and better
    inform the process of evaluation and counseling prior to
    transition."

- abstract: Despite the 2013 decision to replace the diagnostic
    labelling of gender identity disorder with gender dysphoria, there
    remains wide consensus amongst scholars that transgender identities
    are pathologised. Yet the claim that trans identity has been
    pathologised has yet to be rigorously substantiated. Adapting a
    model for verifying the credibility of medicalisation claims, this
    inquiry confirms that the human phenomenon of gender-variance has
    underwent pathologisation to embed trans identity within a medical
    model by (1) historicising how trans identity became viewed as a
    medical condition; (2) highlighting that medical explanations for
    trans identity are adopted by trans people and the culture at large;
    and (3) showing that medical theory for trans identity gains
    traction over any other explanation.

- abstract: When a person openly "regrets" their gender transition or
    "detransitions" this bolsters within the medical community an
    impression that transgender and non-binary (trans) people require
    close scrutiny when seeking hormonal and surgical interventions.
    Despite the low prevalence of "regretful" patient experiences, and
    scant empirical research on "detransition", these rare transition
    outcomes profoundly organize the gender-affirming medical care
    enterprise. Informed by the tenets of institutional ethnography, we
    examined routine gender-affirming care clinical assessment practices
    in Canada. Between 2017 and 2018, we interviewed 11 clinicians, 2
    administrators, and 9 trans patients (total n = 22), and reviewed 14
    healthcare documents pertinent to gender-affirming care in Canada.
    Through our analysis, we uncovered pervasive regret prevention
    techniques, including requirements that trans patients undergo
    extensive psychosocial evaluations prior to transitioning.
    Clinicians leveraged psychiatric diagnoses as a proxy to predict
    transition regret, and in some cases delayed or denied medical
    treatments. We identified cases of patient dissatisfaction with
    surgical results, and a person who detransitioned. These accounts
    decouple transition regret and detransition, and no participants
    endorsed stricter clinical assessments. We traced the clinical work
    of preventing regret to cisnormativity and transnormativity in
    medicine which together construct regret as "life-ending", and in
    turn drives clinicians to apply strategies to mitigate the perceived
    risk of malpractice legal action when treating trans people,
    specifically. Yet, attempts to prevent these outcomes contrast with
    the material healthcare needs of trans people. We conclude that
    regret and detransitioning are unpredictable and unavoidable
    clinical phenomena, rarely appearing in "life-ending" forms.
    Critical research into the experiences of people who detransition is
    necessary to bolster comprehensive gender-affirming care that
    recognizes dynamic transition trajectories, and which can address
    clinicians' fears of legal action---cisgender anxieties projected
    onto trans patients who are seeking medical care.

- abstract: Medical education, research, and clinical guidelines are
    available to support the initiation of gender-affirming care for
    transgender and nonbinary people. By contrast, little is known about
    the clinical experiences of those who discontinue or seek to reverse
    gender-affirming medical or surgical interventions due to a change
    in gender identity, often referred to as detransition.To examine the
    physical and mental health experiences of people who initiated
    medical or surgical detransition to inform clinical practice.Using
    constructivist grounded theory as a qualitative approach, data were
    collected in the form of in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed
    using an inductive 2-stage coding process to categorize and
    interpret detransition-related health care experiences to inform
    clinical practice. Between October 2021 and January 2022,
    individuals living in Canada who were aged 18 years and older with
    experience of stopping, shifting, or reversing a gender transition
    were invited to partake in semistructured virtual interviews. Study
    advertisements were circulated over social media, to clinicians, and
    within participants' social networks. A purposive sample of 28
    participants who discontinued, shifted, or reversed a gender
    transition were interviewed.In-depth, narrative descriptions of the
    physical and mental health experiences of people who discontinued or
    sought to reverse prior gender-affirming medical and/or surgical
    interventions.Among the 28 participants, 18 (64%) were assigned
    female at birth and 10 (36%) were assigned male at birth; 2 (7%)
    identified as Jewish and White, 5 (18%) identified as having mixed
    race and ethnicity (which included Arab, Black, Indigenous, Latinx,
    and South Asian), and 21 (75%) identified as White. Participants
    initially sought gender-affirmation at a wide range of ages (15
    \[56%\] were between ages 18 and 24 years). Detransition occurred
    for various reasons, such as an evolving understanding of gender
    identity or health concerns. Participants reported divergent
    perspectives about their past gender-affirming medical or surgical
    treatments. Some participants felt regrets, but a majority were
    pleased with the results of gender-affirming medical or surgical
    treatments. Medical detransition was often experienced as physically
    and psychologically challenging, yet health care avoidance was
    common. Participants described experiencing stigma and interacting
    with clinicians who were unprepared to meet their
    detransition-related medical needs.This study's results suggest that
    further research and clinical guidance is required to address the
    unmet needs of this population who discontinue or seek to reverse
    prior gender-affirming interventions.

- abstract: Trans people experience high rates of attempted suicide and
    suicidal ideation. No study to date has collated the various
    findings concerning correlates of trans suicide. This systematic
    review aimed to summarize the available data and provide
    recommendations based on this evidence. Articles were included if
    they were published before November 2016, were in English, were peer
    reviewed, and presented data concerning trans people's suicide
    attempts or ideation. Nine databases were searched, and 30 articles
    were selected. Discrimination emerged as strongly related to
    suicidal ideation and attempts, whereas positive social interactions
    and timely access to interventions appeared protective. Limitations
    included differences in how articles defined trans people or
    measured suicide and in their largely cross-sectional nature, making
    assumptions about causality in reference to lifetime ideation or
    attempts impossible. However, results clearly indicated a need to
    work at both individual and structural levels to reduce society- and
    service-level discrimination, enhance peer support, and ensure
    access to required interventions. The review highlights the need to
    explore suicidality in the trans population both in relation to
    general suicide models and in relation to models of minority stress.

- abstract: Amongst (binary) trans people on Youtube, you can find
    reaction videos exposing "transtrenders" or video opinions on
    "transtrending". It has been a hot topic lately. If this is your
    first time hearing about this concept, transtrending is claiming a
    trans identity because of its supposed trendiness. In other words,
    someone may want to claim a trans-identity because it seems cool.
    That's pretty much what this word means. And while this is not a new
    argument (cishet people have been using the trendiness argument for
    any LGBTIQ+ development), transtrending is particularly used by
    trans people to accuse other trans people of not being truly trans.

- abstract: "Introduction: Prejudice and discrimination against
    transgender individuals (i.e., transphobia) is pervasive and has
    been shown to have pernicious effects on the physical (e.g.,
    substance abuse and other self-harm behaviors) and psychological
    (e.g., depression and suicidal ideation) well-being of those
    targeted.Aims: To date, a review of the psychometric properties of
    scales assessing transphobia has not been conducted; this gap
    compromises researchers' ability to make informed measurement
    decisions.Methods: In the current study, 61 articles that contained
    83 scales were identified, and their adherence to best practices in
    psychometric testing was evaluated.Results: Most of the transphobia
    scales included in the current review did not provide sufficient
    information about item generation and refinement, scale
    dimensionality, scale score reliability, or validity. Each scale was
    entered into a table and was ranked on the basis of its total score.
    A score of 1 was issued for each psychometric feature that adhered
    to best practice guidelines, with total scores ranging from 0 to 5
    (i.e., higher scores denote greater psychometric
    soundness).Discussion: Properties of the reviewed scales are
    summarized and recommendations are made for future transphobia scale
    development and validation. The measures that emerged as possessing
    the highest scores and, subsequently, the greatest utility are
    identified."

- abstract: Among LGBTQ people, those who are gender nonconforming (GNC)
    may be at heightened risk of both discrimination and
    underutilization of healthcare---yet little is known about what
    happens during healthcare encounters to compel GNC individuals to
    continue or avoid seeking future care. This study qualitatively
    examines the healthcare experiences of a racially diverse sample of
    34 adult LGBTQ cis women, transgender men, and nonbinary individuals
    in a metropolitan area of the United States who do not conform to
    dominant biomedical schemas of sex and gender. GNC individuals
    experience embodied disruption in medical settings when patients are
    mis/recognized; providers respond to disruption in ways that further
    distress patients. Broadly, participants report similar experiences
    across racial and gender identities, but patients manage disruption
    somewhat differently depending on their embodied positions to gender
    norms. This study contributes to literature of stress, stigma, and
    sex, gender, and sexuality within medicine by illuminating how
    stigmatizing healthcare interactions deter LGBTQ individuals from
    seeking healthcare. Findings point to the importance of considering
    both structural factors and embodied visibility in future research
    addressing how stigma and discrimination manifest within health
    settings to disadvantage LGBTQ groups.

- abstract: "La demanda de atención sanitaria a personas transexuales o
    con incongruencia de género ha aumentado en los últimos años, sobre
    todo a expensas de jóvenes y adolescentes. También en paralelo ha
    aumentado el número de personas que refieren una pérdida o
    modificación en el sentimiento de género inicialmente expresado.
    Aunque siguen siendo minoría, nos enfrentamos cada vez más a casos
    complejos de personas transexuales que solicitan detransicionar y
    revertir los cambios conseguidos por arrepentimientos. Relatar
    nuestra experiencia con un grupo de personas transexuales en fase de
    detransición. Analizar su experiencia personal y los conflictos
    generados y reflexionar sobre estos procesos nunca antes descritos
    en España. Cohorte de 796 personas con incongruencia de género
    atendidas desde enero de 2008 hasta diciembre de 2018 en la Unidad
    de Identidad de Género del departamento Valencia Doctor Peset. De
    los 8 casos documentados de detransición y/o desistencia se relatan
    los 4 más representativos y que consideramos más ilustrativos de
    esta realidad. Las causas observadas que motivaron su detransición
    fueron la desistencia identitaria, las variantes de género no
    binarias, la psicomorbilidad asociada y la confusión entre identidad
    y orientación sexual. La detransición es un fenómeno de presentación
    creciente que conlleva problemas clínicos, psicológicos y sociales.
    Una incorrecta evaluación y recurrir a la medicalización como única
    vía de mejora de la disforia en algunos jóvenes puede conducir a
    posteriores detransiciones. Es fundamental una atención integral
    dentro de un equipo multidisciplinar con experiencia. A falta de más
    estudios que determinen posibles factores predictivos de
    detransición, es recomendable proceder con prudencia en casos de
    historias identitarias atípicas. Health care demand by transsexual
    people has recently increased, mostly at the expense of young and
    adolescents. The number of people who report a loss of or change in
    the former identity feeling (identity desistance) has also
    increased. While these are still a minority, we face more and more
    cases of transsexual people who ask for detransition and reversal of
    the changes achieved due to regret. To report our experience with a
    group of transsexual people in detransition phase, and to analyze
    their personal experience and their associated conflicts. A cohort
    of 796 people with gender incongruence attending the Identity Gender
    Unit of Doctor Peset University Hospital from January 2008 to
    December 2018 was studied. Four of the eight documented cases of
    detransition and/or regret are reported as the most representative.
    Causes of detransition included identity desistance, non-binary
    gender variants, associated psicomorbidities, and confusion between
    sexual identity and sexual orientation. Detransition is a growing
    phenomenon that implies clinical, psychological, and social issues.
    Inadequate evaluation and use of medicalization as the only means to
    improve gender dysphoria may lead to later detransition in some
    teenagers. Comprehensive care by a multidisciplinary and experienced
    team is essential. As there are no studies reporting the factors
    predictive of detransition, caution is recommended in cases of
    atypical identity courses. Los comportamientos autolesivos (CA) y
    suicidas (CS) tienen una prevalencia significativa en personas
    transexuales. Los datos publicados son confusos al no distinguir
    ideación de conducta consumada, grupos de edad, género, ni grado de
    intervención médica. La prevalencia real en España es desconocida.
    Investigar la prevalencia de antecedentes de CA y CS en personas
    adolescentes y adultas jóvenes transexuales, diferenciando entre
    ideación y conducta consumada, antes de recibir tratamiento médico
    de afirmación de género. Revisión retrospectiva de los antecedentes
    descritos en la historia clínica de una cohorte de personas
    transexuales de edad comprendida entre 10 y 35 años, atendidos en la
    Unidad de Identidad de Género de la Comunidad Valenciana. Hemos
    analizado los datos recogidos sobre la presencia de antecedentes de
    cuatro variables: ideas autolesivas, conductas autolesivas, ideas de
    suicidio e intentos de suicidio, así como diferencias por grupos de
    edad y género. La muestra final constó de 110 hombres transexuales y
    90 mujeres transexuales. A lo largo de su biografía el 21% habían
    realizado algún intento de suicidio, el 50% habían presentado
    ideación suicida, el 31% tenían antecedentes de conductas
    autolesivas y el 35% habían tenido ideas autolesivas. No se
    encontraron diferencias según género. Los sujetos menores de 20 años
    presentaron una mayor prevalencia, con diferencia significativa en
    ideación suicida con respecto a los adultos jóvenes (43% frente a
    25%), en cambio, en el resto de variables, las diferencias
    encontradas no mostraron significación. La prevalencia de
    antecedentes de ideación y conducta suicida en población transexual
    adolescente y joven española es relevante y no difiere ni por género
    ni por rangos de edad. La prevalencia de antecedentes de ideas y
    conductas autolesivas difiere y es más frecuente en transexuales
    adolescentes. Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior
    (SB) have a significant prevalence in transsexual people. The
    published data is confusing as it does not distinguish between
    ideation and realization, age groups, gender, or the degree of
    medical intervention. Their actual prevalence in Spain is unknown.
    Our objective was to investigate the prevalence of NSSI behavior and
    SB in adolescents and young transsexual adults, differentiating
    between ideation and consummated behavior, prior to their receiving
    any type of gender-affirming medical treatment. We retrospectively
    reviewed the medical history of a cohort of transsexual people aged
    between 10 and 35 years, treated at the Gender Identity Unit of the
    Valencian Community. We analyzed the data collected regarding the
    presence of four variables: NSSI ideation, NSSI behavior, ideas of
    suicide and suicide attempts, as well as differences according to
    age group and gender. The final sample consisted of 110 transsexual
    men and 90 transsexual women. Of these, 21% had made a suicide
    attempt, 50% had had suicidal ideas, 31% had a history of NSSI
    behavior and 35% had had NSSI ideas. No differences were found based
    on gender. Regarding age, subjects under 20 years of age presented a
    significantly higher prevalence regarding suicidal ideas compared to
    young adults (43% vs. 25%), while in the remaining variables, no
    statistically significant differences were found. The prevalence of
    a history of suicidal ideas and behavior in the Spanish adolescent
    and young transsexual population is significant and does not differ
    according to gender or age range. The prevalence of NSSI ideas and
    behavior differs and is more frequent in adolescent transsexuals."

- abstract: To date, research that has drawn on Meyer's (2003) minority
    stress model has largely taken for granted the premises underpinning
    it. In this article we provide a close reading of how "stress" is
    conceptualized in the model and suggest that aspects of the model do
    not attend to the institutionalized nature of stressors experienced
    by people with marginalized identities, particularly lesbian, gay,
    bisexual, and transgender individuals. As a counter to this, we
    highlight the importance of a focus on the effects of ideology and
    social norms in terms of stress, and we argue why an intersectional
    approach is necessary to ensure recognition of multiple axes of
    marginalization and privilege. The article then outlines the concept
    of decompensation and suggests that it may offer one way to
    reconsider the effects of ideology and social norms. The
    decompensation approach centers on the need for social change rather
    than solely relying on individuals to be resilient.

- abstract: The current increase in the visibility of trans people in
    the media has been accompanied by a backlash in the form of an
    increased deployment of narratives of 'sex change regret' or
    'de/retransition.' Through analysing mainstream media articles from
    2015--2018, this paper identifies and discusses three main themes
    detected in discussions of de/retransition. First, the articles
    claim that the social and political climate has become too accepting
    of trans identities and, thus, any discussion of de/retransition is
    silenced because of 'political correctness.' Second, while the
    articles collected tend to begin with a general discussion of the
    phenomenon of de/retransitioning, they slide into addressing (White,
    cisgender) children and the need to protect them from misdiagnosis.
    Third, the fear about misdiagnosis of (White, cisgender) children is
    intensified by the focus on a recently hypothesised category of
    gender dysphoria -- rapid-onset gender dysphoria -- that suggests
    some children's and adolescents' dysphoric feelings are a result of
    'social contagion.' Mainstream media discussions of de/retransition
    focus on the aforementioned themes in an attempt to question
    contemporary approaches to regulating access to gender-affirming
    medical care for trans individuals.

- abstract: Past studies that compare cisgender to transgender (or
    trans) and gender diverse people have found a higher prevalence of
    mental health problems among the latter groups. This article uses
    Testa's gender minority stress framework, which is an expansion of
    minority stress theory, to assess minority stressors that are
    specific to the experiences of trans and gender diverse people. The
    concept of cisnormativity, an ideology that positions cisgender
    identities as a norm, is used in relation to the gender minority
    stress framework to describe the marginalizing nature of social
    environments for trans and gender diverse people. This article
    provides a critical review that integrates and expands on past
    theoretical perspectives on gender minority stressors and protective
    factors. Specifically, this article demonstrates the relevance of
    cultural and ethnic backgrounds to complement the application of
    intersectionality in research on health disparities experienced by
    trans and gender diverse people.

    \"Community Connectedness\" with the correct number of items, alpha,

    of this article has been corrected.\\] Researchers currently lack a
    reliable and valid means of assessing minority stress and resilience
    factors in transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) people. This
    study was conducted to develop and evaluate the validity of a tool
    to better assess these constructs in TGNC populations. The Gender
    Minority Stress and Resilience (GMSR) measure was developed grounded
    on Meyer's minority stress model, and adjusted to reflect the
    experiences of TGNC populations based on TGNC literature and
    archival data from TGNC focus groups. The final GMSR includes scales
    assessing 9 constructs: gender-related discrimination,
    gender-related rejection, gender-related victimization,
    nonaffirmation of gender identity, internalized transphobia,
    negative expectations for future events, nondisclosure, community
    connectedness, and pride. In the current study, 844 participants
    completed the GMSR measure as well as measures related to mental
    health, general life stress, and social support. Results indicated
    good model fit, criterion validity, convergent validity, and
    discriminant validity for the 9 hypothesized scales. Discriminant
    validity for the scales were also partially supported. Overall, the
    current study offers preliminary evidence of the reliability and
    validity of the GMSR Measure for use with TGNC populations. The GMSR
    Measure has several uses for both research and clinical purposes,
    including increasing understanding of the experiences and correlates
    of gender minority stress and resilience factors and assessing
    whether specific therapies or interventions are helpful in reducing
    risk and supporting resilience in TGNC populations. (PsycInfo

    go back to living as their sex assigned at birth. This study
    examined reasons for past detransition among TGD people in the
    United States.Methods: A secondary analysis was performed on data
    from the U.S. Transgender Survey, a cross-sectional nonprobability
    survey of 27,715 TGD adults in the United States. Participants were
    asked if they had ever detransitioned and to report driving factors,
    through multiple-choice options and free-text responses. A
    mixed-methods approach was used to analyze the data, creating
    qualitative codes for free-text responses and applying summative
    content analysis.Results: A total of 17,151 (61.9%) participants
    reported that they had ever pursued gender affirmation, broadly
    defined. Of these, 2242 (13.1%) reported a history of detransition.
    Of those who had detransitioned, 82.5% reported at least one
    external driving factor. Frequently endorsed external factors
    included pressure from family and societal stigma. History of
    detransition was associated with male sex assigned at birth,
    nonbinary gender identity, bisexual sexual orientation, and having a
    family unsupportive of one's gender identity. A total of 15.9% of
    respondents reported at least one internal driving factor, including
    fluctuations in or uncertainty regarding gender identity.Conclusion:
    Among TGD adults with a reported history of detransition, the vast
    majority reported that their detransition was driven by external
    pressures. Clinicians should be aware of these external pressures,
    how they may be modified, and the possibility that patients may once
    again seek gender affirmation in the future."

- abstract: The aim of this study is to analyze the specific needs of
    detransitioners from online detrans communities and discover to what
    extent they are being met. For this purpose, a cross-sectional
    online survey was conducted and gathered a sample of 237 male and
    female detransitioners. The results showed important psychological
    needs in relation to gender dysphoria, comorbid conditions, feelings
    of regret and internalized homophobic and sexist prejudices. It was
    also found that many detransitioners need medical support notably in
    relation to stopping/changing hormone therapy, surgery/treatment
    complications and reversal interventions. Additionally, the results
    indicated the need for hearing about other detransitioners'
    experiences and meeting each other. A major lack of support was
    reported by the respondents overall, with a lot of negative
    experiences coming from medical and mental health systems and from
    the LGBT+ community. The study highlights the importance of
    increasing awareness and support given to detransitioners.

- abstract: This paper investigates some of the medical and legal
    procedures and policies of sex reassignment within Canada and the
    United States. The leveraging of medical discourse in the fight for
    trans rights reinforces neoliberal discourses of individualism and
    equal rights. Through medicalization, gender-conforming trans
    persons are able to access treatment, such as hormone therapy and
    gender-confirming surgeries, while nonnormative trans persons are
    often denied services. Transnormative narratives of transition
    reinforce medical discourses of what it means to be trans and how to
    be trans. These narratives simultaneously legitimize transsexuality
    for those who can conform to the dominant narrative while
    delegitimizing gender variance and nonconforming trans persons.

- abstract: Four independent studies conducted in three different
    countries evaluated the strength of the Genderism and Transphobia
    Scale (GTS; Hill & Willoughby, 2005), a recently developed measure
    of anti-trans sentiments and behaviors. Study 1 utilized the GTS to
    examine anti-trans attitudes among mental health professionals.
    Study 2 employed the GTS to evaluate the effects of personal contact
    with transpersons, conformity, and perceived threat to social
    cohesion on attitudes toward gender nonconformity. Study 3 examined
    the reliability, validity, and factor structure of the GTS among
    college students in the Philippines. Lastly, Study 4, conducted in
    Canada, used variables from the general literature on prejudice to
    create a comprehensive model predicting genderism and transphobia.
    Collectively, results of this multinational, multisite study further
    support the reliability and validity of the GTS and elucidate
    factors associated with anti-trans sentiments and behaviors.

- abstract: "The Reform of the Gender Recognition Act: Government
    Consultation (2018) catalyzed a heated debate on transgender rights
    and trans inclusion in the United Kingdom. I start by explaining
    what the reforms to the U.K. system of gender recognition propose,
    why gender-critical feminists oppose them, and how other feminist
    academics have responded to their arguments. I then offer a more
    detailed philosophical critique of gender-critical
    trans-exclusionary feminist arguments. I argue that the
    gender-critical feminist case against trans women?s access to
    women-only (or sex-segregated, or single-sex) spaces suffers from a
    number of fallacies, and introduces modes of argument that are at
    odds with well-established and sound uses of practical reason. I try
    to make sense of these problems with gender-critical feminist
    thought by appealing to the idea of presupposed paranoid
    structuralism. I also argue that gender-critical feminists?
    enthusiastic use of social media and allied online platforms may be
    implicated in generating some of these problems."
